Band 9:
    - Full flexibility and precise use are widely evident.
    - A wide range of vocabulary is used accurately and appropriately with very natural and sophisticated control of lexical features.
    - Minor errors in spelling and word formation are extremely rare and have minimal impact on communication.
Band 8:
    - A wide resource is fluently and flexibly used to convey precise meanings.
    - There is skilful use of uncommon and/or idiomatic items when appropriate, despite occasional inaccuracies in word choice and collocation.
    - Occasional errors in spelling and/or word formation may occur, but have minimal impact on communication.
Band 7:
    - The resource is sufficient to allow some flexibility and precision.
    - There is some ability to use less common and/or idiomatic items.
    - An awareness of style and collocation is evident, though inappropriacies occur.
    - There are only a few errors in spelling and/or word formation and they do not detract from overall clarity.
Band 6:
    - The resource is generally adequate and appropriate for the task.
    - The meaning is generally clear in spite of a rather restricted range or a lack of precision in word choice.
    - If the writer is a risk-taker, there will be a wider range of vocabulary used but higher degrees of inaccuracy or inappropriacy.
    - There are some errors in spelling and/or word formation, but these do not impede communication.
Band 5:
    - The resource is limited but minimally adequate for the task.
    - Simple vocabulary may be used accurately but the range does not permit much variation in expression.
    - There may be frequent lapses in the appropriacy of word choice and a lack of flexibility is apparent in frequent simplifications and/or repetitions.
    - Errors in spelling and/or word formation may be noticeable and may cause some difficulty for the reader.
Band 4:
    - The resource is limited and inadequate for or unrelated to the task. Vocabulary is basic and may be used repetitively.
    - There may be inappropriate use of lexical chunks (e.g. memorised phrases, formulaic language and/or language from the input material).
    - Inappropriate word choice and/or errors in word formation and/or in spelling may impede meaning.
Band 3:
    - The resource is inadequate (which may be due to the response being significantly underlength). Possible over-dependence on input material or memorised language.
    - Control of word choice and/or spelling is very limited, and errors predominate. These errors may severely impede meaning.
Band 2:
    - The resource is extremely limited with few recognisable strings, apart from memorised phrases.
    - There is no apparent control of word formation and/or spelling.
Band 1:
    - Responses of 20 words or fewer are rated at Band 1.
    - No resource is apparent, except for a few isolated words.

Band 9:
    - A wide range of structures is used with full flexibility and control.
    - Punctuation and grammar are used appropriately throughout.
    - Minor errors are extremely rare and have minimal impact on communication.
Band 8:
    - A wide range of structures is flexibly and accurately used.
    - The majority of sentences are error-free, and punctuation is well managed.
    - Occasional, non-systematic errors and inappropriacies occur, but have minimal impact on communication
Band 7:
    - A variety of complex structures is used with some flexibility and accuracy.
    - Grammar and punctuation are generally well controlled, and error-free sentences are frequent.
    - A few errors in grammar may persist, but these do not impede communication.
Band 6:
    - A mix of simple and complex sentence forms is used but flexibility is limited.
    - Examples of more complex structures are not marked by the same level of accuracy as in simple structures.
    - Errors in grammar and punctuation occur, but rarely impede communication.
Band 5:
    - The range of structures is limited and rather repetitive.
    - Although complex sentences are attempted, they tend to be faulty, and the greatest accuracy is achieved on simple sentences.
    - Grammatical errors may be frequent and cause some difficulty for the reader.
    - Punctuation may be faulty.
Band 4:
    - A very limited range of structures is used.
    - Subordinate clauses are rare and simple sentences predominate.
    - Some structures are produced accurately but grammatical errors are frequent and may impede meaning.
    - Punctuation is often faulty or inadequate.
Band 3:
    - Sentence forms are attempted, but errors in grammar and punctuation predominate (except in memorised phrases or those taken from the input material).
    - This prevents most meaning from coming through.
    - Length may be insufficient to provide evidence of control of sentence forms.
Band 2:
    - There is little or no evidence of sentence forms (except in memorised phrases).
Band 1:
    - No rateable language is evident.

Band 9:
    - The message can be followed effortlessly.
    - Cohesion is used in such a way that it very rarely attracts attention.
    - Any lapses in coherence or cohesion are minimal.
    - Paragraphing is skilfully managed.
Band 8:
    - The message can be followed with ease.
    - Information and ideas are logically sequenced, and cohesion is well managed.
    - Occasional lapses in coherence and cohesion may occur.
    - Paragraphing is used sufficiently and appropriately.
Band 7:
    - Information and ideas are logically organised, and there is a clear progression throughout the response. (A few lapses may occur, but these are minor.)
    - A range of cohesive devices including reference and substitution is used flexibly but with some inaccuracies or some over/under use.
    - Paragraphing is generally used effectively to support overall coherence, and the sequencing of ideas within a paragraph is generally logical.
Band 6:
    - Information and ideas are generally arranged coherently and there is a clear overall progression.
    - Cohesive devices are used to some good effect but cohesion within and/or between sentences may be faulty or mechanical due to misuse, overuse or omission.
    - The use of reference and substitution may lack flexibility or clarity and result in some repetition or error.
    - Paragraphing may not always be logical and/or the central topic may not always be clear.
Band 5:
    - Organisation is evident but is not wholly logical and there may be a lack of overall progression. Nevertheless, there is a sense of underlying coherence to the response.
    - The relationship of ideas can be followed but the sentences are not fluently linked to each other.
    - There may be limited/overuse of cohesive devices with some inaccuracy.
    - The writing may be repetitive due to inadequate and/or inaccurate use of reference and substitution.
    - Paragraphing may be inadequate or missing.
Band 4:
    - Information and ideas are evident but not arranged coherently and there is no clear progression within the response.
    - Relationships between ideas can be unclear and/or inadequately marked. There is some use of basic cohesive devices, which may be inaccurate or repetitive.
    - There is inaccurate use or a lack of substitution or referencing.
    - There may be no paragraphing and/or no clear main topic within paragraphs.
Band 3:
    - There is no apparent logical organisation. Ideas are discernible but difficult to relate to each other.
    - There is minimal use of sequencers or cohesive devices. Those used do not necessarily indicate a logical relationship between ideas.
    - There is difficulty in identifying referencing.
    - Any attempts at paragraphing are unhelpful
Band 2:
    - There is little relevant message, or the entire response may be off-topic.
    - There is little evidence of control of organisational features.
Band 1:
    - Responses of 20 words or fewer are rated at Band 1.
    - The writing fails to communicate any message and appears to be by a virtual non-writer.

"In many countries, more and more young people are leaving school and unable to find jobs after graduation. What problems do you think youth unemployement will cause to the individual and the society? Give reasons and make some suggestions.","In several countries, nowadays, most teenagers commit to end their study, then majority of the fresh graduate student are looking it so tough to find occupations. This problem would cause the lack of workforces to fulfil certain position in the societies. There are some reasons why these problems occured and two solutions which can be used to deal with these matters.

Most of the youngsters feel that they choose their major incorrectly. Due to lack of infomation, either the program prospect in the future or study field unfitted to their favour. This might led the student’s performance regularly decreas time-to-time. Eventually, this make them find it difficult to deal with a proper occupation. The college students also deal with mental issue such as anxiety, overthinking, or depressed ocassionally. This matter makes them struggle so hard to opt a proper and suitable work for them. This, finally, becomes an obstacle for the graduated student to seek a job; perhaps this the reason why fresh-graduated student numbers are getting more increase.

There are two remedies might be able to utilize to tackle these problems. The fresh graduate students, perhaps, should take special qualification courses or trainings in order to gain their skill which are needed to get an occupation. Some company might offer several jobs which simply meet with certain qualification. This would assist the youth unemployment to obtain jobs. Providing the pre-graduate student with an intensive counceling is equally crucial. As a result of the youth emotional which is still unstable yet, this would trap them into the uncertain circumstances. Hence, some guidances from the university counsellor might help.

In conclution, due to unmatch program which has been picked by the youth and their mental also bother them to make a decision, this causes most of the graduate students were not fit to any works.

"Many people argu that in order to improve educational quality, high school students are encouraged to make comments or even criticism on their teachers. Other think it will lead to loss of respect and discipline in the classroom.

Discuss both views and give your Opinion.","It is obvious that education is directly connected to countries'development so in order to improve a country the educational system must be improved. But it has always been debatable topic how governments should arrange educational policy. Because almost all people have different thoughts on this topic. Especially people comment on connections between teachers and students, it is because of that these two groups play main roles in education. There are different arguments whether students can criticise their teachers or it can be disrespectful. I strongly believe that students are free to tell their own thoughts.

On the one hand, it is true that teachers can be more experienced and mature than students. But it doesn't mean that everything they say is true. Sometimes educated people can also have some mistakes or false beliefs. Or their way of thinking may be different than their students. In that case students should absolutely be free to make their own comments and defend their attitudes. It helps them to be more confident when they express their feelings and thoughts.

On the other hand, those who think it is a reason of losing respect between teachers and their students can be right in some aspects. Generally, students in high schools are not very mature and they can use some rude words in order to express themselves or to criticise someone. Using inappropriate expressions against teacher can cause losing respect to teacher and it would create chaotic classrooms.

To conclude, not only students, but also all people are free to make comments, criticise things that are  not logical for them and to give their ideas. It is possible that students don't like their teachers' ideas, but they must respect them and discuss whatever they want with a polite language.","### Task Achievement

In some countries people encourage teenagers to find part time jobs. Some people agree and others don't. Review both sides and give your opinion.,"There is no doubt that working from a young age makes us independent and self displined. While some people believe that this trend should not be followed, others argue that it helps to build strong minded teenagers. In this essay, I will discuss both sides of the argument and explain my support for the latter view.

One of the most important drawback of teenagers involved in part time jobs is time management. The younsters who work in any part time job are mostly undergarduate students or higher secondary students, because of their part time jobs they get very less time for their studies which in turn leads to bad scores in their marksheets.  Additionally, some part time jobs includes morning and late night shifts, which is the most important time for good sleep. As a reult it directly effects the productivity of the teenagers.

However, part time jobs gives the opportunity to experience real time world apart from studies and college life. Working experience gives the chance to learn from your own mistakes from a very young age, that hepls to build the stronger future. For example, there are some students who does not have any financial support for their education, they  can earn their living and fulfill their dreams, and achieve their goals by their own.

In conclusion, working as a part time can be proven hectic for young generation. In my opinion benefits of part time jobs in young generation are outweighted by the drwabacks, I would prefer top indulge my children in part time jobs.","**Task Achievement:**

"People nowadays tend to have children at older age 

Do the advantage outweigh the disadvantage","Nowadays, people tend to give birth at an older age. This might be due to emotionally preparation of the parents for the process, however, delay in the ability to conceive can also be disadvantage which I believe outweigh the disadvantages which can be medically corrected.

Firstly, many people nowadays believe that child birth and child care is not a small deal, that is why some people want to prepare either emotionally or financially towards having their children. For instance, I once had a neighbor who was a man at the age of 35 and still not married, so I asked him one day that what was his reason for that and he said he doesn’t want his wife or children lack anything whatsoever and that it’s after he made it by having a house and a car with steady income and most people importantly he wanted to be emotionally ready to have a child and get married till he do so, which I think it’s a good idea due to the fact that he wanted to be emotionally grounded before heading into it.

However, inability of the woman to conceive can be a great emotional stress and also causes depression on a long run, but this can be corrected in some ways. For example, I once had a patient who was not able to get pregnant for five years of marriage, many texts was done on both the wife and her husband which all came out good but was still not able to have a baby. Later on, the physician suggested surrogacy which came out well and they had a twin. So, this can be corrected medically.

In conclusion, although giving birth at an older age can be risky or due to some medical issues, I believe the advantage supersede the disadvantage because it reduces stress of coping with children and also to Cater for their children.

Today people are surrounded by advertising. This affects what people think is important and has a negative impact on people’s lives. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"The advertising industry has undeniably thrived in recent decades, infiltrating many aspects of daily life including preferences. From my perspective, I consider this growth to be completely negative as it leads to a distorted perception of reality and overconsumption among consumers.

My foremost concern lies in the tendency of advertisements to cause audiences to falsely perceive the relative importance of major factors in their lives. They generally prioritise material possessions and physical appearance while failing to appreciate the value of other positive qualities. A prime example is advertising campaigns run by cosmetics brands which often praise physical attractiveness as being vital to a healthy relationship, although reliability and sympathy have been long proven by experts to be more influential in fostering personal connections. This well-established truth would likely be more popularly embraced if marketing messages did not exaggerate the significance of physical appearance.

The consumerism caused by excessive advertising is another reason for my disapproval of its popularity. Marketers nowadays are armed with new customer insights and advanced technical tools to skillfully entice viewers into making impulsive purchases. To illustrate, TikTok has developed a detection feature that can constantly identify the preferences and hobbies of users based on their content search, subsequently prompting suitable buying suggestions that accurately trigger their temptation to buy these things. This has given rise to impulsive buying that consequently leads to not only personal debt but also excessive waste which contaminates the environment since more unwanted obsolete items would be discarded. It is a testament as to why advertising campaigns are detrimental at both individual and societal levels.

In conclusion, the prevalence of advertisements appears to me as a disadvantage as they distort the audience’s view of life and breed overconsumption. That is why governments should issue more stringent laws to restrain the development of the advertising industry until the aforementioned issues are comprehensively addressed.","**Task Achievement:**

"Nowadays, we are surround by advertising in our daily lives. Some people believe this has a positive effect on society. Others, however, say that it is a negative development.

There are those who believe that its benefits outweigh its drawbacks and vice versa. I, on the other hand, believe that there is more harm than good that these advertisements bring.

 

Due to advertisements, we are able to be updated about upgraded products and trends that will surely make our lives easier. For instance, high-end cell phones and devices have been flooding the market and have shown different upgraded specifications and functions. Through advertisements, we are also being offered  the best deals like huge discounts and markdowns on once popular products. Advertisements have been constantly reminding us to check out the latest trends and upgrades. 

Nonetheless, advertisements seem to have become more intrusive nowadays. The means resorted to catching the attention of consumers are barely filtered out already. On the internet, for example, advertisements have been popping up more often that  instantly distract the viewer from browsing the actual content he or she wishes to see. Another instance is paper flyers that have ended up being scattered anywhere in the streets and thus become garbage polluting the surroundings. Every nook and cranny is now covered with sorts of advertisements and has destroyed beautiful scenery.

"A lot of old people are suffering from loneliness these days. They also lack physical fitness.

What do you think are the reasons for this problem?

Can you think of possible solutions?","Nowadays, a significant number of old people are becoming looner, they do not have physical activities as well. In this essay, I will describe the ongoing reasons for this issue and address the possible solutions. 

First, we cannot ignore the consequences of social media, the human being as a result of progress in technology  becoming depressed and  other mental health problems. Therefore, old generations do not want have any physical activities as they compare themselves to influencers on Instagram, They also suffer from loneliness as most children leave their parents and have their own life  . For instance, sadly,  old society in Iran has been suffering from being alone more than ever as most of the occasions their children went  abroad. One solution for this matter is to participate in the majority of classes. Thus, they have less time for spending on social media and thinking of their children. 

Second,  one of the vital stuff which makes us who we are is our habits, things we are used to doing.  Accordingly, many things we do when we are old are stuff we have done in  the past in our youth time. As an illustration, young people rather than playing outdoor games prefer to play online and this seriously harms their bodies and minds. So, old generations should make physical exercise and socialise with other people their habits when they are young.  This can be done by warning teenagers at schools to have these activities a part of their lives to not suffer in the future. 

In conclusion, these days, a lot of old communities are becoming alone and they do not have physical activities as well. In this essay, I described the ongoing reasons for this issue and mentioned the possible solutions.","**Task Achievement: 3**

Some people think that secondary school children should study international news as one of the school subjects. Other people think that it is a waste of valuable school time. What do you think? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"The never-ending debate of adding foreign news as one of the subjects of secondary school syllabus is not new. However, the news of overseas current affairs opens the doors for opportunities in indirect ways.   I believe that international news must be a part of the school syllabus for various useful reasons that will be discussed in this essay further. 

Since globalization has arrived and the internet has made everything clear, many students entail a lot of knowledge about world affairs. The growth of efficient organizations in developing countries is opening numerous opportunities for everyone. For example, technology innovations in a country like China are mindblowing, many engineers or technical students from developed countries wish to work in companies situated in China. All these news let the students explore what is going on in the world, and where they can be fitted. Moreover, we all are learning from each other; the success or failure of one country's economy is a lesson for others. For instance, a less peaceful country would look into the reforms of the most peaceful countries - i.e. Newzealand or Canada. Therefore, knowledge lets countries learn from each other. 

Measuring the other benefits; helps students to know about the areas on which the world is competing. Like sports, Television, E-sports and other activities that give countries get power and fame. For example, there are stories of heroes they share online that helps student boost their confidence and morale. Besides, it might help the students in different fields to explore information about their subjects. We can take an example of medical students who can gain knowledge of different disease testing equipment or methods that are used in developed countries. In short, obtaining overseas news opens the intellectual horizons and thoughts of students. 

To summarize, I would suggest that students should know what is happening around the world so that they should adapt to positive change in their life. In my opinion, international news lets students learn practically; whereas, bookish knowledge becomes hard to apply in practical life without examples.","**Task Achievement:**

Some people believe that the government should take care of old people and provide financial support after they retire. Others say individuals should save during their working years to fund their own retirement. What is your opinion? Give reasons for your answer and include examples from your own experience.,"There is a subject of controversy whether workers should put aside while working for their retirement or depend on pensions that they receive from the government. Both of these views will be discussed in this essay.
On the one hand, some people believe the government is responsible for pensions. Workers are considered as a crucial factor to determine one nation's success because they have devoted themselves to working as well as to the betterment of society. Hence, after retiring, they have a right to be provided with finance. For instance, in Vietnam, medical students spend over 6 years in university and keep on getting higher medical qualifications, then they are always on the run in the hospital while working to help patients and reduce the mean mortality rate. With these contributions, they deserve to receive financial support while retiring.
On the other hand, putting by on their own has some benefits. This could lessen the financial burden on government and more state budget will be used for improving other life aspects such as poverty in remote areas or education for the underprivileged. Moreover, having independent savings enable old people to be more active in having a well-fed life as well as let their offsprings not be worried about them. With savings, retired workers could pursue their own hobbies and improve their spiritual life such as fishing with old friends or treated themselves a vacation.
In conclusion, although the government takes responsibility to provide pensions, saving for retirement let old people be more active in their life.","## Task Achievement:

To begin with benefits, robots will be quicker because if same job is assigned to an indvidual and a machine it will be apparent second one will finish the wrok faster. for example,, to build a five stroy bulding genral labour will take atleast two years but when its replaced by robots it will be only the matter of few weeks.

"Some people believe that children at school should learn art, others says it is a waste of time.

Some believe that teenagers should learn art at an early age, while others would say that It is waste of time as well as money. This essay strongly agrees with Children should learn the art field because It increases their creativity and develops their minds. 

The primary reason students learn arts is that It improves their problem-solving skills. This is because If they learn painting and many more arts improve their mental abilities as well as develop their mind as well. For instance, a study conducted by American Management School found that around 60 per cent of teenagers who learn arts they are well performed in maths subjects because of their problem-solving abilities. 

Another reason is that they are more creative than any other children. Arts means creativity and if schools teach artists so, teenagers improve their creativity at an early stage.

"Some people think that instead of preventing climate change, we need to find a way to live with it. To what extent do you agree or disagree?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Climate change is one of the most essential topics in today’s world. Accordingly, there are many approaches in order to solve this major problem. While there are some people who consider climate change as something that can be lived with, others give it extreme importance and look for powerful solutions for its prevention. I strongly believe that this severe issue is something to be dealt with. For that reason, we must take individual actions and force governments to act in accordance with necessary precautions.

First and foremost, I must state that raising awareness and commencing individual action constitutes the most effective part considering the prevention of the alterations in the climate. Specifically, individual action forms a cumulative organization due to its nature. To illustrate, decreasing the frequency of using automobiles and aircraft makes a considerable difference in terms of the continuing process of climate change. Clearly, it provides low waste of gas which spreads to the air. 

Second, after taking individual action, people must cajole governments into taking relevant measures for the elimination of possible outcomes of this matter. Furthermore, all around the world, governments are initiating and managing investments with a plethora of other governments or private companies in order to maintain economic development. However, the irresponsible behaviour of politicians in monetary terms harms the future of young generations. Therefore, to exemplify, people must force governments not to make investments in fossil fuel and sectors that cause high carbon emissions.

In conclusion, the tendency of living with climate change and not trying to stop its negative effects in the environment should never be the policy of any country. We absolutely cannot just live with it. Instead, everybody must comply with the rules and regulations set forth under respected institutions and non-governmental organizations for avoiding the consequences of it. By taking individual steps and pressuring governments, we can get positive results and leave a clean and viable earth for the next generations.","**Task Achievement: [6]**

Some people think competitive sport is important for a child’s education. Others think it has negative effects on children. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"An increasing number of people are concerned about the purpose of teaching sports at schools. Many people believe that schools should offer competitive sports in a curriculum, while others are against it because it may negatively affect children. In my opinion, I would argue that competitive sports should not be allowed at schools as they may bring many drawbacks to children.

It is a belief that competitive sports bring many advantages for children in the future. First, competition is a natural instinct in humans, and it is likely to strengthen children’s personalities. Therefore, competition is healthy because it pushes people to give their best or even over their limitation. Second, children need to experience these competitions at schools. This is due to the fact that when they graduate from schools, they have to step into the real world where people have to compete with one another to get jobs in daily life.

On the other hand, the negative effects of competitive sports should not be overlooked. The first reason is that sports should provide children with a sense of enjoyment rather than competition. Addionally, playing sports with their peers can build their relationships and teamwork skills. If competitive sports are brought to the curriculum, their relationships will be disjointed and fragmented. Another consideration is that playing sports encourages children to have physical and mental development, meaning that they become healthier and may have fewer diseases, such as diabetes. Whereas competitive sports may make them feel stressed because they have to against one another for higher grades.

In conclusion, sports are great activities for children’s development. Personally, I believe that competition in schools brings more harm than benefits.","**Task Achievement:**

To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"It is debatable that teens should volunteer during their leisure time. Due to the fact, that volunteering can benefit both teenagers and society. I completely agree with the above statement so I will explain my opinion using examples from the United Kingdom and Sri Lanka. 

Youngsters´ participation in unpaid work influences them positively. I will begin with that involving teenagers in volunteering activities converts them to be good-oriented adults in the future. In addition, taking responsibility for these kinds of helping works capable to teach many qualifications, for instance, leadership, task performance, and being more disciplined. As an example, During the UK school children’s gap year, they often volunteer to take after the elderly who need help. Also, Research confirmed the immense impacts of this on improving the participated candidates’ kindness, caring, patience and humility. 

Moreover, teenagers’ volunteer work can empower the development of the communities.

How can people research this?,"The number of residents who are interested in searching the past of dwellings they live in is increasing in some regions. In this essay, I will describe the reasons and the way how residents find history.

 There are some reasons why the occupants tend to find  the history of their living places. Firstly, people consider that the history of their house is important because the culture of circumstances and neighbours have been impacted and the residents need to stay in that culture. Therefore, they are induced to find the history to check whether the culture is the one they like. Another reason is that residents prefer to stay in dwellings that have good stories. For instance, the places renowned persons such as presidents families, leaders for revolution, skilled professors stayed, residents can imagine how they contributed to nations and became famous.

"Schools should focus on academic success and passing examinations. Skills such as cookery, dressmaking and woodwork should not be taught at school as it is better to learn these from family and friends. To that extent do you agree or disagree.","It's argued that schools should pay more attention to students' academic success in exams instead of teaching cooking, sewing and crafting skills as they can be acquired from relatives and friends. This essay strongly disagrees with the opinion because these skills support a well-rounded education for all students and can contribute to a stable income in the future.

It's undeniable that culinary, sewing or wood-making classes make up a well-rounded education for students besides the traditional academic subjects. In the learning process of these skills, pupils can apply knowledge from other classes and take on numerous soft skills. For example, learning about culinary can help combine a myriad of information from biology into understanding how different food combinations affect our bodies, practice making meal plans and prepare healthy dishes on their own.

Another reason for my disagreement is that we're experiencing the rising number of unemployed people due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the global financial crisis. Therefore, students who are able to excel in numerous skills can help a student have more diverse career paths and ensure a continuous source of income without depending on a sole job. For instance, after being laid off in their 30s, a couple in China recently became an Internet sensation for utilizing their cooking skills to successfully change their positions from software developers to street food merchants. 

In conclusion, this essay strongly disagrees with the belief that schools should only focus on students' academic success instead of teaching them life skills such as cooking or crafting. The reason is that these subjects add up to a well-rounded education for the students and can ensure them a more stable income in the future.","**Task Achievement:** 7

Human activities have negative effects on plant and animal species. Some people think it is too late to do anything about this problem. Others believe that effective measures can be taken to improve this situation. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"In recent years,  the development of human civilization has led to many adverse impacts on various other living species.It is argued by a few individuals that much little can be done to tackle this problem, while others think advanced measures can be helpful in controlling the circumstances.This essay will discuss both  notions along with my opinion.

On the one hand, the development of human actions has caused global-level concerns related to animals and plants.First of all,  people have cut huge numbers of trees , which has snatched the habitats of wild creatures , disturbing their normal living, and increasing chances of endangerment and extinction.Taking deforestation as an example, leading to an increased number of problems such as floods , droughts, destruction of habitats and food shortages . However, the solution of more plantations may not become possible due to excessive soil erosion and lack of land.

On the other hand, people believe that circumstances can be made under control if effective measures are taken right away.To begin with,if the community has already realised the value of planting trees , then the government should make provisions related to logging.Moreover , advanced technology can prove effective in protecting endangered animals.For example, China has been utilising genetic technology, especially to protect panda's life.Additionally , the crowd ought to be encouraged to plant more and more trees.Therefore , the adoption of these solutions can be helpful in tackling global concerns directly from the root level.

Some employers believe that job applicants’ social skills are more important than their academic qualifications. Do you agree or disagree with this opinion?,"Some recruiters suppose that for candidates, soft skills are more crucial than academic background. I totally agree with this notion as social abilities are the bottom line when getting jobs.

Firstly, being equipped with interpersonal skills such as communicating and interacting with co-workers helps job applicants to discuss with others and figure out solutions in any type of working environment. Hence, even a newbie who does not much specialized knowledge can contribute to solving and accomplishing assignments. Although academic capabilities play vital roles in the working process, they might become less effective in teamwork tasks requiring novel ideas from different perspectives if individuals are not able to connect with other colleagues in the workplace.

Secondly, the ability to multitask is also important in people’s careers, especially in these days and ages when everything happens fast and simultaneously. If a worker is merely good at technical knowledge, he might be confused due to a lack of capability to complete different tasks constantly. Consequently, he will become overwhelmed by heavy workloads with tight deadlines then. For instance, in the advertising field, being able to handle many tasks is always prioritized as the employees have to monitor campaigns, make new plans and meet clients’ requests at the same time and their performance outcomes will be evaluated based on all the aforementioned scopes as opposed to solely professional knowledge.

In conclusion, despite the undeniable importance of candidates’ educational backgrounds, I believe that being good at soft skills such as communication or multitasking is crucial in people’s careers since it can help them to improve not only individual results but also collective outcomes.","**Task Achievement:** 6.5

"Nowadays, more and more people decide to have children later in their life. What are the reasons? Do advantages of this outweigh disadvantages?","In the present age, the major section of  society has a mindset to conceive a baby after entering  the thirties. People believe that they should first focus on their career and after being successful, they will plan regarding family life. In the following paragraphs, I will discuss  the possible reasons for this thinking and further, I will give valid points as to why having children later in life could possibly lead to disadvantages.

To begin with, the root cause for this mindset is that nowadays, society has money minds and they want to earn a handsome amount of money in the initial stage of their career. For the purpose of earning money, young couples avoid conceiving, because they think that with kids, they will not be able to target  their careers. Furthermore, the young generation like to do social interactive activities by having parties  and going on vacation with friends and they like to enjoy their life like a free bird. But, our generation believes that after having a child, life will not be the same. So, that's why couples avoid having kids at the early stage of marriage. For instance, after a child, you cannot go to late-night parties and you cannot leave him alone at home. So, after having offspring, your whole day revolves around them and you cannot spare time for yourself and it is a valid reason by people do not want to conceive early.

Though  people want to have kids later, there are certain drawbacks to choosing this path. Firstly, after a certain age, the count of sperm decreases and similarly females also start facing hormonal issues due to which sometimes it becomes impossible to give birth to a baby naturally. The second drawback is that when  individual plans to have offspring at a later stage, in this case, the age gap between parents and children increases. Due to this, there is a generation gap among both  generations which leads to clashes between children and parents. 

So, in the end, I would like to conclude that though a career also matters in the individual's life  at the same time, he should also focus on family growth and try to maintain a balance between both roles.","## Task Achievement:

The essay adequately addresses the given task. The candidate presents relevant ideas and arguments in response to the prompt.

"Some employers believe that job applicants’ social skills are more important than their academic qualifications.
Do you agree or disagree with this opinion?","In today's ,world social skills are given utmost importance over the educational background and many of the recruiters try to employ candidates with such qualities.  I partially agree with the statement and I would like to elaborate on it in detail below.

The merits of outstanding social skills are apparent.  Firstly, communication is the key factor that helps to interact with different people on the whole and assists in creating a good buyer-seller relationship.  It can promote the growth of the business too.  Secondly, by having good communication skills anyone can excel in their respective fields either it may be sales or any other departments for the matter of fact.  For example, an employee with excellent presentation expertise can help customers understand the products and can convey them to buy that product.  Furthermore, employees with better interaction skills are generally easygoing, which is crucial for the workplace and the employer too.

In contrast, some people believe that academics are the pre-requisites of  employment.  Apparently, there are many positions that require high knowledge and capability of dealing with them smoothly.  For example, an administrative role in a company requires the applicant to have high qualifications to take prompt managerial decisions.  Such qualities are developed when a person has studied the subjects thoroughly.  Not only having social skills but also acquiring higher studies is equally important to run any organization smoothly.

In conclusion, I think both advanced studies and other communicational skills are of equal importance in today’s world.  Having workers with both these qualities make an organization grow and prosper thereby helping in building a strong workforce altogether.","### Task Achievement:

"Some people think the main benefit of international cooperation is in the protection of the environment, while others think that the main benefits are in the world business. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","With the rapid development of globalization in the past decades, many countries get profits due to the increasingly strong bonding through the intensive interaction with others. The environmental protection and economy have equally benefited from such international cooperation under the background in major regions.

On the one hand, it is commonly known that environmental problems have a heavy toll on the well-being of the whole society. Thus,applying global cooperation can unite more countries and clear the responsibilities of each in preventing detrimental pollution. A great case in point is that the developed countries can support many high-tech devices and professional experts in the developing regions to tackle the environmental problems that can not be solved by limited local technology and lacking of biologists and chemists and so on.What is more, a great number of extinction species can also be rescued by the international organisations when they face detrimentally killing result of the lagging traditions in specific areas.

On the other hand, the international connection allows entrepreneurs to extend their businesses out of the country, which could make rational use of different resources to help the economic development on both sides.For example, many western companies set up factories in Asia since there are more low-price labour forces and some factories were set in the original source of goods in order to reduce the transportation cost. What is more,one more beneficial fact caused by international cooperation is that the foreign businesses also create many job opportunities for local citizens in some developing countries where the industrial development is primitive and inferior.

Lastly, such online classes decline the gist of learning which as physical interaction which eventually leads to loneliness and depression.

Consumers are faced with increasing numbers of advertisements from competing companies. To what extent do you think consumers are influenced by advertisements? What measures can be taken to protect them?,"It is crucial to consider the impact that many advertisements from different business competitors have on their customers. This essay will explore some of the issues which have resulted from this effect and propose some measures that might address them.

Firstly, one concern about using advertising is that people are tricked into buying things that are not necessary for them. This is because they are enticed to catch up with the latest trends, especially from celebrities they have been following. As a result, people squander their hard-earned money, which should have been poured into their long-term financial investments, on extravagant commodities. To tackle this issue, governments should educate their people about the essence of living below their means. In doing so, people will ensure not only do they have a wealthy and perennial future, but they also contribute to reducing waste.

Secondly, another significant issue associated with advertisements is the risk of misled harmful products. The reason for this is that, nowadays, there are a lot of companies which merely chase their benefits recklessly. These businesses try to get their customers to buy their products as much as possible without considering the future repercussions that may occur, which is a real danger in the context of medical supplies. For instance, people could perish due to misusing drugs, but televisions and newspapers today are saturated with abundant strength-boosting pills. This problem could be mitigated by tightening the advertisement regulations to ensure many noxious ads are filtered before they reach end customers. 

In conclusion, advertisements from competing businesses have created two problems which are extravagance and detrimental products. However, these issues could be minimized if governments invest effort in improving citizens’ knowledge and stiffening advertising regulations.","**Task Achievement (8)**

Job applicants’ social skills are more important. Some employers believe that job applicants’ social skills are more important than their academic qualifications. Do you agree or disagree with this opinion?,"Some recruiters value social skills more than academic qualifications when it comes to assessing candidates. I disapprove of this opinion because our professionals will help us most in handling tasks, and interpersonal ability can be acquired continuously after being employed.

First and foremost, many jobs prioritize your certificates or experience in relevant areas. For example, right at the first round of employment, programmers are required to finish at least a good Bachelor's degree in computer science in order to pass. This is because this type of document reflects clearly your level of problem-solving, critical thinking and understanding of what you're going to do in those positions, otherwise, just being decent in sociability doesn't help you anything in coding or system designing.

My second argument is that people skills can be gained through the working process. For instance, most technological firms in Vietnam often organize seminars or side activities to consolidate their employees' communication and English qualities. By doing so, instead of including conversational potential as a must-have criterion when interviewing, companies can teach their staff later, encouraging them to develop their well-rounded capability to be able to promote themselves to higher positions such as project manager or negotiator, and more than that, it's also the best way to bond every member in the organization together.

To conclude, some employers say that for an applicant, his social qualities are more valuable than his achievements in education. I strongly refute this point of view since the knowledge you obtain from your academy is the most helpful tool to complete your deadlines, as well as people can ongoingly learn soft abilities after joining the companies.","**Task Achievement:**

Human activities have a negative effect on plant and animal species. Some people say that it is too late to do anything. Some people think that we should take effective action to improve the situation. Discuss both sides and give your opinion. ??,"There are controversial perspectives heating up a debate over how to solve the negative effect issue caused by human activities on plant and animal species. While some hold a strong view that it is too late to measure the problem, the opposite makes a statement that we should enhance the situation with effective actions. I would contend that take effective actions to revamp the matters, which do more good than harm.

 It is obvious to note that there are many reasons to convince that it is too late in order to solve the negative effect of human activities on plant and animal species, one of them is deforestation. Having an ever-growing demand for land to live and wood to consume, humans decide on deforestation to serve their purpose. Therefore, it leads to flora and fauna being indiscriminately destroyed and lost completely instead of being replaced and it pushes many categories of species on the verge of extinction.  For example, Panda is China’s national treasure, but this species is on the brink of extinction because of deforestation. There is a wealth of animals in the world that are dying out because of human activities, which is the reason people doubt that it is too late to tackle the problem. 

 While the redeeming features of negative effects of human activities on flora and fauna species are widely acknowledged, we will find an address in order to enhance the issue. Plant and animal species play a paramount significant role in human’s life, so we should find a solution as soon as possible. One of the remedies is to build a reserve to create a safe habitat for endangered animals. For instance, Cuc Phuong national park in Vietnam is built and overseen by the authorities, which is home for a wave of precious animals. Hence, the situation will be resolved and revamped if people actively implement it.             

 In conclusion, although there are many reasons to prove that it is too late to deal with the negative effect on plant and animal species caused by human activities, people should take effective action to improve the problem.","**Task Achievement:**

Many customs and traditional ways of behaviors are no longer relevant to the modern life and no worth keeping. Do you agree or disagree?,"Some people argue that many traditional customs and behaviours have been updated in the modern world and should be abandoned. However, I completely disagree with this point of view and believe those traditional customs deserve to be kept.

The main reason why most traditional customs are worth keeping is that they are still useful in the modern world. While some traditional customs including unconditionally following policies made by the king have been replaced by the democratic political system, there are still quite some traditional customs that adapt well to modern society. For example, people in east asian countries are still used to shaking hands when they meet new friends or business partners, which has been followed for more than 1000 years and is still a great way to help quickly establish friendship or business cooperation. Consequently, those kinds of traditional customs should be kept.

Another important reason for keeping certain traditional customs and behaviours is that they are essential records of human history. For instance, in the Western world, people celebrate Christmas and in many countries in East Asia and Southeast Asia such as China and Vietnam, people celebrate Lunar New Year, which gathers family members together and reminds people of the history of their ancestors. These traditional customs have built a bridge between modern civilization and ancient history, which is a priceless treasure in human beings’ history. Therefore, it is important to preserve some traditional customs.

In conclusion, although some outdated traditional customs deserve to be abandoned in the modern world, I firmly believe that some traditional customs are vital parts of human history and are still applicable in modern society and thus should be kept.","## Task Achievement:

Human activities have negative effects on plants and animal species. Some people think that it is too late to do anything about this problem. Other people believe that effective measures can be taken to improve this situation. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"Environmental conservation has become a trending topic in recent years. Pessimists claim that there is nothing that can be done to save the Earth, while others argue that human beings still have a chance to modify the situation. In my view, I agree with the latter and I will provide an explanation with examples.

First of all, it is undeniable that human activities have brought a number of serious problems to the Earth due to the increase in human demands based on populations. For instance, the average temperature has increased one Celsius since the 1800s, which mainly caused by deforestation, farming and burning fossil fuels. This leads to a threat to many Arctic species such as polar bears in particular as their habitat is melting and disappearing.

On the other hand, others including me believe there is still hope because the awareness of environmental protection and sustainable development has raised in recent decades. To be more precise, many countries have started to tackle the negative effects brought by human beings, like reducing overexploitation of natural resources. Instead, professionals are researching and finding other renewable and Eco-friendly resources to limit the demands on fuels. Besides, afforestation is encouraged to offset the damage by deforestation. China is one of the best examples, which the overall forest coverage rate has risen from twelve per cent in the early 1980s to twenty-three per cent currently. As a result, the air quality in China has improved dramatically compared with thirty years ago.

In conclusion, even if human activities have caused grave consequences and even some permanent damage to our plants and wildlife, it is not completely irretrievable as long as human beings can learn from previous mistakes and insist on sustainable development.","### Task Achievement: 8

The typical teaching situation of a teacher and students in the class will not exist by the year 2050. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Numerous characters deem our conventional educating program will be altered, and students will not be attending class; in contrast, certain groups of people oppose and affirm pupils will be studying at school. Besides this, the old educational program will be lasting as usual. I reckon the current model will surely be changed by the 2050s.

Firstly, I view the revolution has already started. Thanks to cutting edge technology, now we have more options to continue lessons and business. For example, all college, universities, and companies stopped to work because of coronavirus, rendering people to live under quarantine, but still, my university's teachers have been lecturing their lessons using the internet and social channels including Facebook, Google Meet, and Zoom. Hence, this trend will definitely influence the traditional tutor and student interaction.

Secondly, this brand new teaching approach is more sustainable and effortless than any method which had been existed before. As arriving at school and coming back home takes a lot of time, and we usually do not attend class when we ill. However, we can take a course from schools by using a mobile phone or computer today, which is simple and has no obstacle. For instance, since I started acquiring knowledge from the internet curriculum; I realized that it took fewer hours than taking tutorials from the college. Thus, I prefer this new trend and presume its enhancement is inevitable.

Some people think that robots are important for human’s future development. Others think that robots have negative effects on society. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"In recent years, humans are heavily adapted to advanced technologies and it has become an integral part of life. Robots are considered to be one of the greatest innovations of mankind. Certain individuals believe that they are harmful to humans while some stratum of society argue that they are crucial for the future. I personally believe that robotics is a positive development for the world.

To begin with, some people assert that these techno-savvy machines can endanger human life. This is because robots are not emotionally intelligent to distinguish what set of operations are right or wrong; which can have a detrimental effect. To illustrate, a recent accident involving a Telsa electric car that killed two people points fingers at its autonomous driving feature. Moreover, these robots running on a specific algorithm are in the early stage of development that can be exposed to hacking. For instance, if these machines are employed in the banking sector, there is a high probable chance of account hacking and other fraudulent activities. 

On the other hand, benefits derived from the invention of robots are significant for the development of the future. Most importantly, these automated machines can be deployed in places that are hazardous to humans. For example, a robot called Mini-Manbo has become the central part of the cleaning-up process in the damaged Fukushima reactor, where it is dangerous for humans to execute these tasks. Additionally, the heavy automation by robots in the automobile industry and hazardous chemical plants has reduced stress on employee’s health and increased productivity and precision in these sectors.

In conclusion, although, some argue that robots can be potentially life-threatening and cannot be considered safe to be employed in various industries such as banking, I strongly believe that they can bring a positive change for the future.","## Task Achievement:

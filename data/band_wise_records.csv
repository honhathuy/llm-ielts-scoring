"In many countries, more and more young people are leaving school and unable to find jobs after graduation. What problems do you think youth unemployement will cause to the individual and the society? Give reasons and make some suggestions.","In several countries, nowadays, most teenagers commit to end their study, then majority of the fresh graduate student are looking it so tough to find occupations. This problem would cause the lack of workforces to fulfil certain position in the societies. There are some reasons why these problems occured and two solutions which can be used to deal with these matters.

Most of the youngsters feel that they choose their major incorrectly. Due to lack of infomation, either the program prospect in the future or study field unfitted to their favour. This might led the student’s performance regularly decreas time-to-time. Eventually, this make them find it difficult to deal with a proper occupation. The college students also deal with mental issue such as anxiety, overthinking, or depressed ocassionally. This matter makes them struggle so hard to opt a proper and suitable work for them. This, finally, becomes an obstacle for the graduated student to seek a job; perhaps this the reason why fresh-graduated student numbers are getting more increase.

There are two remedies might be able to utilize to tackle these problems. The fresh graduate students, perhaps, should take special qualification courses or trainings in order to gain their skill which are needed to get an occupation. Some company might offer several jobs which simply meet with certain qualification. This would assist the youth unemployment to obtain jobs. Providing the pre-graduate student with an intensive counceling is equally crucial. As a result of the youth emotional which is still unstable yet, this would trap them into the uncertain circumstances. Hence, some guidances from the university counsellor might help.

In conclution, due to unmatch program which has been picked by the youth and their mental also bother them to make a decision, this causes most of the graduate students were not fit to any works. However, by giving them professional courses and guiding them with counselling class, it would be the best actions to cope with these situations.","**Task Achievement:**

"Many people argu that in order to improve educational quality, high school students are encouraged to make comments or even criticism on their teachers. Other think it will lead to loss of respect and discipline in the classroom.

Discuss both views and give your Opinion.","It is obvious that education is directly connected to countries'development so in order to improve a country the educational system must be improved. But it has always been debatable topic how governments should arrange educational policy. Because almost all people have different thoughts on this topic. Especially people comment on connections between teachers and students, it is because of that these two groups play main roles in education. There are different arguments whether students can criticise their teachers or it can be disrespectful. I strongly believe that students are free to tell their own thoughts.

On the one hand, it is true that teachers can be more experienced and mature than students. But it doesn't mean that everything they say is true. Sometimes educated people can also have some mistakes or false beliefs. Or their way of thinking may be different than their students. In that case students should absolutely be free to make their own comments and defend their attitudes. It helps them to be more confident when they express their feelings and thoughts.

On the other hand, those who think it is a reason of losing respect between teachers and their students can be right in some aspects. Generally, students in high schools are not very mature and they can use some rude words in order to express themselves or to criticise someone. Using inappropriate expressions against teacher can cause losing respect to teacher and it would create chaotic classrooms.

To conclude, not only students, but also all people are free to make comments, criticise things that are  not logical for them and to give their ideas. It is possible that students don't like their teachers' ideas, but they must respect them and discuss whatever they want with a polite language.","### Task Achievement

"Some people believe that studying at university or college is the best route to a successful career, while others believe that it is better to get a job straight after school.

Discuss both views and give your opinion.","Many people think that the getting a knowledge at college or university is greatest way to take a position in every wanted sphere.However, others reckoning that this is better to find employment.Although,there are benefits from working after school,I would argue that it is better to go to university or college .In the following paragraphs,let me elaborate both viewpoints and share my position on this drawback.

The point of start work straight after school is so stunningly solution .Lots of people want to earn money as soon as available.And this is crucial reason to start working after high-school.Because of job,many teenagers are able to get experience to future humanity career.This means that,on account of less responsibility on your head,when you make a significant mistake in your teenager ages,you would have to more chances to correct it than in adult years.But the accomplish,which you can get at the your job time,will be able to help you in your future position in each sphere.

On the other hand,we have to think about new technology on science or on our lifestyle,which is speedly improving by years.Humanity must develop his all sides respectively to new technology.In my opinion,we have to be ready for new generation of technology.Because active evolution of technology poses a threat to humanity that the robots and machines can replace position of people in future.But do not forget that the robots and machines are absolutely without emotions and morality.And because of them Humanity also must be developed,and people should go to university to improve his knowledge about a world and humanity.And this is noticed that consequence from study at university is better than working straight after school for us.

Some people think that one of the best ways to solve environmental problems is to  increase the cost of fuels for cars and other vehicles. To what extent do you agree or disagree  with this statement?,"Over the past decades, environmental problems have never failed to draw public attention  and provoke debates. Although the severity and urgency of addressing environmental  problems properly are hardly arguable, the issue as to whether governments should deal with  these issues with higher price of fuels or not remains controversial. From my own perspective,  I consider this approach is ineffective.  Firstly, it is important to recognize that although the occurrence of positive outcome towards environment is almost inevitable, the final result may not be as expected for long. Some may  hold optimistic attitude that this particular approach would be the effect on limiting the  number of cars and thereby reducing the amount of environment-damaging gas emission. This  argument could be true to some extent. However, they should take into account the fact that  since the cost of public transport would also be affected, resistance in people with the need of  travel seems to be inevitable, hence the impossibility of achieving the desired goal. Therefore,  increasing fuel prices will not make any significant changes.  Secondly, it is equally important to recognize that there is evidence that waste gas from cars is  not the leading cause of air pollution. The opponents may argue that the combustion of fossil  fuels by cars is the main producer of carbon dioxide. Nevertheless, they are ignorant of the fact  that the chef culprit is the discharge of pollutants into the atmosphere due to the rapidly growing  manufacturing industry. Governments could better handle this problem if they could increase  control over industrial waste-discharge and adopt more environmental friendly materials and  production equipment. For example, wind and tidal power in the Netherlands, nuclear power in  Japan and solar power in the United States have all proven their efficiency  in energy  production. This example indicates that other solutions could be employed in other parts of the  world to minimize the global dependence on fossil fuel.  In conclusion, under no circumstances should increasing the price of fuels be taken as the best  solution to environmental issues, as it has neglected both the reaction of consumers and the  root cause of the problem as mentioned above.","## Task Achievement:

"Some people think that museums should be enjoyable places to entertain people, while others  believe that the purpose of museums is to educate. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","People tend to have different views about the function of museums. Some think that they should be  a place for enjoyment, while the others are certain, that it is important for them to be educational.  In this essay I will discuss both views and state my opinion.  On one hand, it can be said that the main role of museums is to be a place of entertainment. If there  is going to be too much educational content, some visitors might become bored and that way less  people will be interested in visiting places like that. Nevertheless, museums are tourist attractions  and attract many visitors in general, so big part of society thinks, that they should emphasize the  enjoyment, create more interactive activities or some sort of games, so that the exhibitions could be  more entertaining for people of all ages and that way more people would take interest in visiting  places like that.  On the other hand, a big part of the society believes that not everything in this world should be all  about fun and games. They are sure that the main point of any exhibition is to help people learn  about something they did not know previously. This means that the story behind every exhibit  should be explained, and this can be done in various ways. Some museums have professional guides,  and the others offer audio guides, so that the visitors can listen to a commentary about every single  object and explore them by themselves. That way people do not have to read long and boring  descriptions and then museums can play a big part in helping people broaden their knowledge in  many different aspects of life.  To conclude, I believe that museums should be a place, where you can do both – broaden your  knowledge and have some fun at the same time. Especially when there are various","**Task Achievement:**

Some people believe that one of the best ways to solve environmental problem is to increase the cost of fuel for cars and other vehicles. To what extent do you agree or disagree? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Raising the price of petrol for vehicles and other transportation is one of the best ways for some people who believe that can solve 

environmental problems. I would like to share some of my opinions about it.

First of all, I agree that increasing the cost of fuel for cars and other vehicles is one of the best ways to solve environmental problems because nowadays there are too many cars running on the streets. Almost everyone has a car and does not like to use public transport because it is difficult to go to work by bus or metro ,especially from a suburb. However, if the government can raise the price of petrol and make their transportation systems more friendly, it will make citizens and tourists use it generally due to the financial concerns.

Secondly, the government can make some packages for the public transportation to inspire people to take them instance of driving their own cars. For example, if people can get discount from taking public transportation, they will be willing to do it from time to time. Besides, between different places, the governments can build systems for people to bike, if it is convenient for everyone to rent bikes from one place and return to another, it will be more and more popular for people to use it and make the environment friendly.

On the other hand, it is not only because  the cars produce too much carbonatite but also many other facts. Due to many studies, climate-changing 

 is cost by many different issues which include making products related to meat, factories, agriculture...etc. Therefore, all of the facts cost different levels of environmental problems and it 

all results in climate-change.

In conclusion, though there are many issues cost the environmental problem, I believe it will have a good result if the fuel price increase and everyone will definitely be concerned about the cost and make new methods to itface.","## Task Achievement:

We learn till our last breath and it is actually responsible to  improve our character, It defines what kind of human being we would be.

In my opinion there should be transparency in the process where we can validate the on going  process like cameras or recordings. In this way authorities can track their own performance and  make changes rather than giving power to developing minds.

First, of ,course one of the ways to reduce  global environmental problems is to increase the cost of fuel, which makes people think twice before using their car or turning on the heating, They will use it at the needed time, not every time. For instance, I remember when I was in Syria and petrol was very expensive, we had not used it a lot, and we heated one room instead of three.

Second, there were a lot of methods to make people reduce using  fuel, like decreasing the price of electronic cars, encouraging them to ride the popular buses or trains and making workshops to be aware of the environment and their problems. For example, I have my own car, and I look forward to having an electronic car but it is so expensive compared to mine or normal cars.

"Some people think that museums should be enjoyable places to entertain people, while others believe that the purpose of museums is to educate. Discuss both views and give you own opinion","Every person has different beliefs about a purpose of museums. The majority of people believe that museums should be visited as an entertainment while others think that this place is to educate. In my opinion, I see museums as a place where people can do both fun and get knowledge.

On the one hand, not everyone in this world enjoy visiting a monument because most of the people are not really interested in history or geography. Furthermore, they will be bored if there is no something funny to see. For instance, research reveals that more than 30% of teenagers that went to museums felt no enjoyable. Some of them even wanted to go home earlier. As a result, a function of museums should be added more to be entertain.

On the other hand, generally, museums are related to history, and some of them contain many ancient artefacts and weapons. This purpose is to give public new knowledge about our past conditions or how our heroes sacrificed themselves. For example, in Yogyakarta, there is a house that constructed into a museum that show Indonesian history. Because of this, tourists and visitors can see real-life example of a country history, and they can get education that they can not get in schools.

In conclusion, although a function of museums is to educate people, it is not wrong to turn museums into entertainment places.","**Task Achievement:**

However, the writer's own opinion is not clearly stated until the conclusion, which is not the most effective placement.

Some beleive it puts great effect on the whole music industry while other argues that artists'first priority is to become popular through the viral songs. In my opinion, financial lose to the company may lead to be bankrupt. So I agree with the first group, who are against illegal uploads.

In some countries people encourage teenagers to find part time jobs. Some people agree and others don't. Review both sides and give your opinion.,"There is no doubt that working from a young age makes us independent and self displined. While some people believe that this trend should not be followed, others argue that it helps to build strong minded teenagers. In this essay, I will discuss both sides of the argument and explain my support for the latter view.

One of the most important drawback of teenagers involved in part time jobs is time management. The younsters who work in any part time job are mostly undergarduate students or higher secondary students, because of their part time jobs they get very less time for their studies which in turn leads to bad scores in their marksheets.  Additionally, some part time jobs includes morning and late night shifts, which is the most important time for good sleep. As a reult it directly effects the productivity of the teenagers.

However, part time jobs gives the opportunity to experience real time world apart from studies and college life. Working experience gives the chance to learn from your own mistakes from a very young age, that hepls to build the stronger future. For example, there are some students who does not have any financial support for their education, they  can earn their living and fulfill their dreams, and achieve their goals by their own.

"People nowadays tend to have children at older age 

Do the advantage outweigh the disadvantage","Nowadays, people tend to give birth at an older age. This might be due to emotionally preparation of the parents for the process, however, delay in the ability to conceive can also be disadvantage which I believe outweigh the disadvantages which can be medically corrected.

Firstly, many people nowadays believe that child birth and child care is not a small deal, that is why some people want to prepare either emotionally or financially towards having their children. For instance, I once had a neighbor who was a man at the age of 35 and still not married, so I asked him one day that what was his reason for that and he said he doesn’t want his wife or children lack anything whatsoever and that it’s after he made it by having a house and a car with steady income and most people importantly he wanted to be emotionally ready to have a child and get married till he do so, which I think it’s a good idea due to the fact that he wanted to be emotionally grounded before heading into it.

However, inability of the woman to conceive can be a great emotional stress and also causes depression on a long run, but this can be corrected in some ways. For example, I once had a patient who was not able to get pregnant for five years of marriage, many texts was done on both the wife and her husband which all came out good but was still not able to have a baby. Later on, the physician suggested surrogacy which came out well and they had a twin. So, this can be corrected medically.

In conclusion, although giving birth at an older age can be risky or due to some medical issues, I believe the advantage supersede the disadvantage because it reduces stress of coping with children and also to Cater for their children.

Surveys show that many people believe most jobs in the future will be done at home.Do you agree or disagree ?,"Now a days many surveys depicts that “work from home” is the upcoming future trend. This essay completely agrees with the statement because this will save quite an amount of resources for the companies and moreover, it is comfortable for the employees.
To begin with, many companies will allow their employees to work from home. In almost all multinational companies, majority of work is done on the computers online contrary to the work done in the past which was done manually. Work like attending meeting, presentations and conversation with the clients can be easily done with the help of internet and it is not mandatory to go to the office. This saves huge amount of money with regards to paying rents, electricity bill and other running cost. A study performed on America’s largest company has proven that there is no significance difference between the efficacy from working in the office and from home along with positive impact on company’s balance sheet.
Secondly, it is very convenient for the employees to works from home. Going to the office and travelling long distance drains lot of energy and is very tiring and this negatively affect the overall performance. This can be negated by staying home and working in homely and comfortable environment. Several researches have shown that employees who are working from home have fewer health problems and less family issues as compared to the regular employees.

"Leaders and directors in organizations are normally older people. Some people think having a younger leader would be better.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Commonly speaking, heads of institutions are older members of society. According to some people's opinion younger administrators would influence the management system in a better way. I am inclined to agree with both of the ideas for a number of convincing reasons.

The first idea set out can be true for two solid reasons I am about to explain. Since the beginning of humanity elderly people are always respected and almost every idea, they put forward were always supported without any doubt. The second reason, based on a stereotype, is that older members of public are seen as more experienced and omniscient individuals, hence directors of associations, enterprises often found to be older people.

Regarding the second idea that is claimed, I utterly agree that well-educated younger people would make a better leader as they are full of energy, open to endeavor new management techniques for the best of their workplace. For instance, young ambitious worker would go through sleepless nights to create a project that can benefit to the company and their career and that can be realised thanks to their robust health. In my view, this derives from the urge to prove themselves in society as a prosperous young leader.

To sum up, I am in agreement with the opinion that chiefs of people in organizations are generally older people due to their work experience and reputation they collected over the years. However, I also believe that in times of acute competition where everyone is dealing with the modern technology and methods younger generation can overcome the challenge better.","### Task Achievement:

I strongly believe that government officials must putting their energy on tackling the toxicity on the air and households need because of two reasons which are locally and internationally.

The main reason why I believe that government have to solve the problem of toxicity in the air and their citizen’s housing is because they have a local duties toward citizen which means that themselves are obliged to offers these needs. Furthermore, countries should have go after citizen needs and one of the fundamental needs are to live in area where the air is clean and to have a place to sleep. Despite the fact, that government’s officials are citizen at the end.

Another reason why I think that countries need to solve any problem related to environment and household so because they have an international duties toward their citizens. Obviously, most of the countries are in the United Nations and to be member countries have to agree to the United Nation’s rule. In fact, most of the rules are talking about what are the human needs such – housing, jutice, safety, and health -; therefore, all countries must offer these needs to their citizen.

Employment should give their staff at least a 4-week holiday a year to make employees better at their jobs. To what extend do you agree or disagree?,"Holidays are provided by companies to their personnel for various reasons. Some employment grants sick leave, casual leave as well as annual leave as per policy. In my opinion, I agree that a 4-week break a year is a great idea to make institute prosper at their jobs. It gives department extra encouragement as well as helps them to mitigate personal issues to feel tension-free with the help of a long break.

To begin with, catalyst is a key factor that enables staff to do well in their duties and having a 4-week break annually definitely helps. For example, After getting such a long leave personnel will come back to their workstation with reinvented energy as whatever dissatisfaction they have will fade away by the time they join. It is a natural boost for department to do well. Above all, desire is always a major factor in any type of responsibility.

On the other hand, Felling relieved is always a welcoming factor for any employee and having a 4-week holiday in a year job holders can easily solve their personal issues. According to  recent research by a Workforce provider organization, staff who stay tension-free in their job from personal issues do significantly well than those who don't. Relived employees from any type of family problems are always a plus point. Finally, with a long leave, Any external factors can be easily manageable.

Some people believe that teenagers should be required to do unpaid community work in their free time. This can benefit teenagers and the community as well. To what extent do you agree or disagree.,"It is argued that unpaid community can develop student's behavior to keeping up their productivity. I agree with this view because voluntary jobs can help teenagers to learn how maintain their time management and also learn how to be a good communicator in the future.

Time management is the important things for students before they will become adults. . For example, when people are working in a company which prodives services, if they were not be able to make a better preparation, the customers would be angry with their services because of the unhurried and delayed performance. People who have a good management can easily to complete their daily task in schedule, especially in the future when they will be having some unpredictable situations that make them to behave wisely and responsibility.

When people working in the society, they can not choose with the who that they are likely to work, so that they have to be ready worked with the oldest group of the people.

"In some countries, more and more people are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the house or building they live in 

-What are the reasons for this? 

-How can people research this?","Nowadays, we can find growing number of people who are inclined to find out histories of their accommodations in some countries. It would be interesting and productive to figure out the reasons for this surging interest, and the way to research this. 

In terms of reasons for this, I believe there are economic and educational reasons. First and foremost, the financial motivation is the biggest and outstanding. In some countries, there are many antique cities containing ancient building built in middle age. If the old building has special history and the owner could reveal it, he could earn a myriad of money. For example, if the accommodation I live was once an office of Adam Smith, the father of modern economic theory, the value of building will certainly upsurge.

By studying the history and collecting anecdotes of building, children can easily learn the history of their family, hometown. It could be challenging but also riveting project. In this way, history education would be much friendly to many children. 

For researching the history of buildings, I can suggest three methods. First of all, meticulous research of old writings, including history books, novels, biographies are important. We can find some hints from those literature. And in terms of reliability, historical writing is most credible source. In addition, anecdotal approach will be also useful. History telling form elderly people who lived nearby building would be one of the most important sources. It would give detail information about building, also it could invigorate our imagination. Lastly, art and architecture approaches are also significant. This approach can help find the origin of the building.

"In some countries more and more people are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the house or building they live in.

What are the reasons for this?

How can people research this?","There is increasing tendency amongst people from some nations who want to know more about the history of the house or building they live in. This can be out of some curiosity or just for fun to share with their family. However, it can be needed for more practical reasons such as interior or reconstruction. This essay will explore the reasons behind this trend and suggest how to find out useful information.

Some people may be simply curious about who previously had lived in their house and whether any special or unusual events had happened there. These stories can be either a good-luck sign or a cautious point for them if there had been some successful or dangerous stories and give them a wider perspective where they dwell.

Others, on the other hand, may wonder about the specific information for their certain purposes. They may be willing to rebuild the house or make a big interior change of it. For those reasons, some researches about the house like the date of construction, structure and materials used are needed in advance. Since learning about the accurate information and history is sometimes crucial for the conservation or reconstruction.  

To collect such information of a house or a building, there are various ways available. The easiest way is to ask your real estate agency of previous owners of the house. You can trace a lot of behind stories in short time. Those can be fun but may not be quite useful, though. In terms of the practical and official information,  you can visit the websites of city council and managing authority to track them. Lastly, checking out a library in your neighborhood may be a decent choice. They may have tons of information or archives about the area and also each buildings respectively.

Do advantages of this outweigh disadvantages?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience. 
You should write at least 250 words.","In these career oriented world people are postponing their family planning to late stage of their life. Perhaps, the most important reason is goal oriented. In my opinion, benifits of having offsprings in later age offsets the drawbacks entailed by this trend, as one can focus on their career and enjoy their life.
The major disadvantage of this trend offers is related to health. Having childrens in later stage may pose a risk to the mother because they may not be healthy enough to give birth to child. These may result in birth of a child with abnormal syndrome. For example, a research published in gynegology has found that females giving birth after the age of 35 years are highly prone to give birth to a diseased child.
Firstly, primary reason behind planning children in later stage is that these days people are becoming more career oriented. These means that they have to put their energy, time and money in acheving their dreams.
These may make them competent for upbring of their childrens in a well manner.
Moreover, having childrens at later stage offers several advantages. The first obvious benifit is that people can acheive the heights in their careers as they can focus on theri career. They can devote all their resources and energy in to acheving their dreams. For instance, a growing body of research have found that 80% of people are successful in their career those who have planned their offspring in later stages of life.

To begin with, people who work in their spare time for an unpaid wage are responsible for society. It is the community's intention to provide an opportunity to learn time management as well as various experiences, such as how to communicate with diverse people, compassion for one another, and unity to work well together, which are essential parts of becoming a reasonable person.

"Schools should focus on academic success and passing examinations. Skills such as cookery, dressmaking and woodwork should not be taught at school as it is better to learn these from family and friends. To that extent do you agree or disagree.","There is the number of people who thinks that schools should focus only on  academic success and help students to pass their examination and skills like cookery, dressmaking and woodwork should not be taught in  schools. They state, that these skills can be developed by parents as well as by friends of that student. From my perspective, I strongly believe that this statement is correct, but I will be explaining both points of view with the support of some relevant examples.

To commence with, schools should focus mainly on the studies of the students. Providing them with better education,  is the main objective that the parents send their children to school. This helps them to get better remarks in the examinations, which help them to improve their academic background. In addition to this, students with  excellent academic records may receive  better job opportunities in future as compared to  other people. For  instance, there are many countries with parents who want their children to be a doctor or an engineer, instead of chefs or fashion designers. This kind of fields can only be achieved if the children focus more on their studies and examinations instead of some other activities. Even there are few guardians or parents who suggest that the school should provide sports activities instead of some extracurricular activities.

In contrast to this, students and their parents prefer that school should have some other skills aside from the subjects and examinations, such as cookery, dressmaking and woodwork. This helps them to develop their resume stronger and opens many industrial opportunities. Let's assume that the school have some other activities such as cookery, this will help the student to grow their foundation if he or she wants to be a chef.

To conclude, schools should provide some  other extracurricular activities but should not make them mandatory for every student to learn them. This will help students  achieve whatever goal they want to achieve.","## Task Achievement:

The candidate has adequately addressed the task by presenting both sides of the argument with clear and relevant ideas.

Regardless of having equal or superior skills to their male counterpart, women often feel societal pressure and cultural norms work against them while seeking jobs. Interviewers question the female applicants about their martial and parental status to understand their personal commitments before offering them the job, hence women are pushed to carefully guard their details in an interview, so they don’t lose out on the job. Additionally, not having a collage degree or computer science graduation tend to lower their confidence at workplace or when applying for jobs, because in many cultures’ families encourage men to pursue higher education while women are pushed performed household activities. For instances in Asian countries people believe that men are bread winners of the family as well as invest in their education but on the other hand women are taught to take care of the home and perform domestic work. All these factors make the career path of a woman more challenging.

Many women activist across the globe have brought up this issue to the society and fought gender equality in job market. As result of this, today many corporate companies incorporated polices to ensure their work force have equal number of women and men employee. Other than this IT sector need diligently transform their corporate culture to respect all employees, moreover make discrimination and gender inequality socially unacceptable. These changes will make the womenfolk feel more secure and boost their morality, thus we can perhaps close the gap between gender disparity.

To conclude, cultural norms need to change in employment and educational settings to permanently eliminate the problem of gender discrimination, so every woman can feel confident, supported and safe as they pursue their dreams.","## Task Achievement:

"Some people believe that the main purpose of schools is to turn children into good citizens and workers instead of benefitting them individually.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?","There is belief that says ""The main purpose of schools is to turn children into good citizens and workers instead of benefitting them individually"". I mostly agree to this statement. A school teachs not only an academic lesson but also a social lesson to correct students' conduct. Moreover almost all school have similar lessons, so students will grow up to be same good adults. But maybe there are some places that are not similar to others.

First of all, In every school, they teach general academic subjects such as Math, Science, English and etc. In addition to these subjects, there are lessons intented to make the students become responsible citizens of the society. For example, social studies or law studies that teach students what they should and should not do. And that they will recieve punishment if they do something wrong. Also, when students spending their time in schools, they will learn how to behave and interact with each other. School disciplinary is also the way to guide children to the good path.

Furthermore, because every school have the same standard for the graduated students. Their curriculums tend to be the same. And that has a negative effect on the student. Because everyone has his own talent. Teaching students the same thing doesn't mean that thay will get equal score. To illustrate, when someone who's good at drawing and someone who's good at Math study Algebra together, he who excels at Math will do better. But, does this mean that students who get bad grades are bad student? No, they may be bad at Math but they have something they good at too. Unfortunately that their capabilities have to be measured with an only same standard.

However, some schools may not be like the others. There are a few schools whose intent are not just to bring up their student to be good people but encourage them to be the best version of themself. These schools still have the same requirement for their students to meet. but they support things that are not in the requirement too. To give examples, some schools permit students to join clubs of their interests after studying periods, such as, art club, music club and sports club. Furthermore, these schools curriculum may not limit to just science course and social studies course. They have other course like literature, management and art course too.

To sum it up, every school have similar ways of teaching and preparing their students to become good citizens and workers of the societies. Yet, they teach the same things to every students , despite the fact that everyone is unique and has his own way of learning. Therefore, you could say that this way of teaching doesn't benefit their students individually. That's why i agree with this statement. However, there might be some schools that do it differently. While keeping the standards like other schools, they support their students individually too. For their intentions that students will grow up not only to be good citizens, but also to be themself that they dream of.","### Task Achievement (4.5)

In my opinion, yes money is the most important factor for many people to stay in the workforce.

The working personnel is the backbone of any nation or company, the smooth working of the organization depends on the wellness and contentment of the labour pool.

Today people are surrounded by advertising. This affects what people think is important and has a negative impact on people’s lives. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"The advertising industry has undeniably thrived in recent decades, infiltrating many aspects of daily life including preferences. From my perspective, I consider this growth to be completely negative as it leads to a distorted perception of reality and overconsumption among consumers.

My foremost concern lies in the tendency of advertisements to cause audiences to falsely perceive the relative importance of major factors in their lives. They generally prioritise material possessions and physical appearance while failing to appreciate the value of other positive qualities. A prime example is advertising campaigns run by cosmetics brands which often praise physical attractiveness as being vital to a healthy relationship, although reliability and sympathy have been long proven by experts to be more influential in fostering personal connections. This well-established truth would likely be more popularly embraced if marketing messages did not exaggerate the significance of physical appearance.

The consumerism caused by excessive advertising is another reason for my disapproval of its popularity. Marketers nowadays are armed with new customer insights and advanced technical tools to skillfully entice viewers into making impulsive purchases. To illustrate, TikTok has developed a detection feature that can constantly identify the preferences and hobbies of users based on their content search, subsequently prompting suitable buying suggestions that accurately trigger their temptation to buy these things. This has given rise to impulsive buying that consequently leads to not only personal debt but also excessive waste which contaminates the environment since more unwanted obsolete items would be discarded. It is a testament as to why advertising campaigns are detrimental at both individual and societal levels.

In conclusion, the prevalence of advertisements appears to me as a disadvantage as they distort the audience’s view of life and breed overconsumption. That is why governments should issue more stringent laws to restrain the development of the advertising industry until the aforementioned issues are comprehensively addressed.","**Task Achievement:**

"Nowadays, we are surround by advertising in our daily lives. Some people believe this has a positive effect on society. Others, however, say that it is a negative development. Discuss with both views and give your own opinion.","Advertisements have been part of our daily activities for a long period of time now. There are those who believe that its benefits outweigh its drawbacks and vice versa. I, on the other hand, believe that there is more harm than good that these advertisements bring.

 

Due to advertisements, we are able to be updated about upgraded products and trends that will surely make our lives easier. For instance, high-end cell phones and devices have been flooding the market and have shown different upgraded specifications and functions. Through advertisements, we are also being offered  the best deals like huge discounts and markdowns on once popular products. Advertisements have been constantly reminding us to check out the latest trends and upgrades. 

Nonetheless, advertisements seem to have become more intrusive nowadays. The means resorted to catching the attention of consumers are barely filtered out already. On the internet, for example, advertisements have been popping up more often that  instantly distract the viewer from browsing the actual content he or she wishes to see. Another instance is paper flyers that have ended up being scattered anywhere in the streets and thus become garbage polluting the surroundings. Every nook and cranny is now covered with sorts of advertisements and has destroyed beautiful scenery.

"A lot of old people are suffering from loneliness these days. They also lack physical fitness.

What do you think are the reasons for this problem?

Can you think of possible solutions?","Nowadays, a significant number of old people are becoming looner, they do not have physical activities as well. In this essay, I will describe the ongoing reasons for this issue and address the possible solutions. 

First, we cannot ignore the consequences of social media, the human being as a result of progress in technology  becoming depressed and  other mental health problems. Therefore, old generations do not want have any physical activities as they compare themselves to influencers on Instagram, They also suffer from loneliness as most children leave their parents and have their own life  . For instance, sadly,  old society in Iran has been suffering from being alone more than ever as most of the occasions their children went  abroad. One solution for this matter is to participate in the majority of classes. Thus, they have less time for spending on social media and thinking of their children. 

Second,  one of the vital stuff which makes us who we are is our habits, things we are used to doing.  Accordingly, many things we do when we are old are stuff we have done in  the past in our youth time. As an illustration, young people rather than playing outdoor games prefer to play online and this seriously harms their bodies and minds. So, old generations should make physical exercise and socialise with other people their habits when they are young.  This can be done by warning teenagers at schools to have these activities a part of their lives to not suffer in the future.

"In some countries, more and more people are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the house or building they live in. What are the reasons for this? How can people research this?","It is true that plenty of modern citizens nowadays pay more attention to the history of their living place. There are many reasons for this trend of behavior, and also a variety of ways to conduct an effective research in order to fulfill this desire.
The most obvious reason behind the will of investigating one's house's past is the raised awareness of people about history. The pedestrians now understand that knowing what had happened before they moved there is a way to show respect to previous holders of the house, as well as the community they are living in. Furthermore, having knowledge about the accommodation and its neighborhood will make it easier for the newcomers to get acquainted to people around there. For example, when one man get to know that his house has been preserved as a historical heritage, he would treat it more responsibly and have a better attitude with his neighbors, who might also care about his house.
Because of this change in mindset of the new citizens, public also provides a wide range of methods for those who want to have researches about their house's history. One of the ways is by books in local libraries and tours to different places in the area, conducted by the authority and guided by people who have been living there for a long time. However, in my opinion, the most effective way to gain more understandings about one's house is by asking the pedestrians in that area about what he is curious about. The information from these residents is more accurate and lively than reports published, which may have been modified in order to be appropriate to a variety of kinds of reader.

"Some people think watching TV is bad for children, while other think that watching TV has more beneficial effects on children. Discuss both views and give your opinion","Everything has two sides. In terms of watching tv, some believe that it has a good effect on kids. But, on the other hand, many believe that this will generate bad result for children.

For people that think tv will bring beneficial effects for children, they might be thinking that tv shows will give wider range of information for kids. For example, the child that used to watch documentary movies will have more information rather than the one who does not. Furthermore, through their favourite tv shows kids will find that process of learning more enjoyable and fun. Nowadays, the word has become borderless. It is mean that various information from all over the world is accessible for everyone. Netflix,for example, gives particular tv shows in differents languages for kids in the other countries. This will trigger kids to learn languages in the most enjoyable way.

In contrast, for the others who believe that tv shows will bring worse impact for their children, they were worried that children have tendencious to copy all things that they have seen on tv. This condition will create a big problem in society. For example, kids who used to see action movies are more likely to act violently to their friends or their adults. another example, recently there are more youths who smoke since the early age. This conditions were also believed caused by watching inappropriate tv shows for their age.

On top of that, people have much less time to assist their children in watching tv shows. These conditions are caused by many factors, one of these factors is more pressure in work which will lead people to easier their supervision to their kids. in another case the parents will let their heir watch tv shows as they want, in order to make them calm.

To sum up, in my opinion, tv shows will have a beneficial impact on kids as long as they are accompanied by their parents. Thus, the parent can select appropriate tv shows that inlined with their kid's age. Another method is involving AI programs on their tv, so the tv show will get filtered based on the age of their kids.","## Task Achievement:

I believe there are many reason why they do this; however, this essay will disscuss about the reasons and in which way individuals know about the history.

In my opinion, one of the reasons is people want to know the specific detail of their living place. If they know about it, they will be ready if there is something wrong in their new place.

So, they can repair it as soon as possible to prevent unwanted accident. Another example, they need to know about other amenities such as sport center or security equipment like CCTV.

"In the past, people stored knowledge in books. Nowadays people stored knowledge on the Internet. Do you think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?","Today's, cutting-edge technologies change human being life significantly. subsequently, This matter affects storing way of books. Although some communities believe that e-book destroys the nature of the book, others think that this technology gives a new and better meaning to the book. In this essay merits and demerits of both points of view will be discussed.

New tools and inventions in the last century, give people improved methods to store data like text. This way of storage is more intelligent because we can transport these very easily. To illustrate, the transportation of 1000 reports in the past was a really huge work to be done but now we can move them on a CD. Moreover, disasters such as war, flood, earthquake, and fire could destroy libraries and consequently millions of reports in a fraction of a second. To clarify, keeping bills on hard disks is safer. In addition, using hard disks for storing statements eliminate neccecety of cutting trees to write  books. 

On the other hand, from the readers' point of view, reading bills on paper is more comfortable. for example, they claim that e-book affects human eye health. Additionally, they say electronic books do not have the same good feeling as paper books. Also, researches show that concentrating on a subject is more when you read it on paper.

In conclusion, like other technologies, keeping reports on hard disks or reading them on the screen has both negative and positive sides. However, I think its advantages are more than its advantages.","**Task Achievement: 4**

"2) Some people believe that teenagers should be required to do unpaid community work in their free time. This can benefit teenagers and the community as well.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Teenager is a very active phase of life when they have so much curiosity to explore about the world.  In order to utilize that energy in a positive way, I do believe that they need to be involved in a social work as a volunteered. This will help for a community as well as teenagers themselves as it will give them a kind of sense of being worthwhile in a society. Moreover, it is obvious that community will get benefit from it as it will help to build harmonious society.  

There are three reasons why I recommend to include teenagers in unpaid social work. Firstly, when teenagers start working in the community from the early age of their life, they will learn different life skills which will be useful for them in the future. Furthermore, it will help them to gain work experience which will make their life easy to find the job in their adulthood. Moreover, teenagers will feel the sense of being included and being part of the society which help them to grow mentally and physically. Thus, I strongly support to involve teenager in social activities. 

Secondly, encouraging teenagers in social work will help to lower the risk of them getting involved in illegal activities. As teenagers are very curious by the nature to see the world and they can easily influences by other as their articulative ability to distinguise right and wrong is not fully develop, they might choose the wrong way during this stage of life. Therefore, keeping them busy in community work in their free time will help to distract them from making the bad decision in their life. 

Thirdly, involving teenagers in a community volunteer work will set an example for others to be selfless and help each other. Moreover, it will help to build a peaceful, harmonious and cooperative environment in the community. In addition, observeing teenager doing the social work will encourage others to do the volunteer work in future. Furhtermore, teenagers will feel empower, proud and confident being part of the society and being able to bring the change in the community. 

Thus, it is beneficial for both community and teenagers themselves, I would highly recommend them to participate in social activities.","**Task Achievement:**

"Some people think the best way to solve global environmental problems is to increase the cost of fuel.

To what extend do you agree or disagree

?","Global environmental changes are unquestionably the most prevalent and worrying issues in any society, and their prevention should be taken seriously. Despite a few problems, such as plastic production and the absence of recycling, I reckon that the decision of the raising prices for fuel is definitely the best way to prevent the worldwide catastrophe.

On one hand, the main environmental issue of global warming is caused by two significant factors, which are burning fossil fuels and deforestation. Firstly, expensive fuel could actually decrease a number of cars bought by people due to the fact of economic purposes. As a consequence, people would have a lower level of horrible emissions, which are produced by cars. Secondly, if the amount of vehicles is stable, hundreds of new roads would not be needed, and more forests and parks could be saved. Therefore, the greenhouse effect, caused by transport pollution, could be managed by the natural process of carbon dioxide absorption.

On the other hand, there are still a few factors, which could not be removed by changing a price tag. It is known that plastic has not been already replaced by other materials, so its production could not be immediately restricted. Moreover, most people are not used to recycling various types of waste, consequently, tons of rubbish are supposed to threaten the surrounding area. Therefore, hundreds of humans consider fuel price raising to be an inappropriate solution.

To conclude, despite varying opinions, I believe that the advantages of increasing the cost of fuel completely outweigh the relative disadvantages. Without a doubt, this solution would be the first useful step, which government should take in order to protect the environment.","## Task Achievement:

In this essay, I am going to discuss both views as well as why I believe that it can be extremely usefull, in particular for youth.

Firstly, I think that every society has its own genere of music due to the fact that musician instrument developed during the year and also the mind of people changed as a consequence that preferences could be different compared with the past. The fact is provided by the number of variations that every kind of music experienced during their life, in fact, several singer are not related to only one genere of music but we can catalogue in many of them.

"The shortage of housing in big cities can cause severe consequences. Only government action can solve this problem.




To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Metropolitan cities face a severe shortage of accommodation  leading to declining health and rising crimes.,Apparently the issue can be tackled  only by a government intervention either by putting a limit on on the entry of new people into cities or by expanding the urban region.The public contribution is limited in solving the issue as  the root cause of the shortage of land remains unresolved. 

 

Since the basic issue lies in the lack of space for building houses,the community has a limited role in executing a long-term solution.Temporarily,they may resolve shortage by sharing homes or residing in the countryside and travelling daily for jobs.The former solution can result in poor  health due to overcrowding and lack of adequate basic facilities while the latter would cause mental stress to those commuting long distances daily.Both these would affect the productivity of these people in their jobs.

The government can make a marked change in this situation by restricting the entry for new residents as that can give more time to solve the current housing issues.Then the administration should ensure that the population is proportionate to the land available and take measures to sustainably build adequate housing apartments.An alternative solution wud be by subsuming nearby farmland or expanding the outskirts of cities so as to provide the required amount of land for building suburbs.

 

In conclusion,I believe that the housing shortage in metropolia can be effectively solved by the government either by having a practical ratio of citizens with land or by expanding the land to build new residences.City folks have a limited role as they can only adapt to the available accommodation though it is with great difficulty.","**Task Achievement:**

"Nowadays celebrities are more famous for their glamour and wealth rather than for their achievements, and this sets a bad example to young people.
To What extent do you agree or disagree?","In this modern era, high profile people are becoming popular with the masses just because of their alluring and charismatic personality. The crowd starts following their idols blindly which in turn plays havoc with their own persona and sets a wrong precedence for the coming generation.. This essay will discuss about the unnecessary hype of money and upper class status  without knowing the harmful effects on society and I strongly support this opinion.

In present scenario, actors have indulged themselves into wrong activities like smoking, drinking and partying late night. They have a misconception that they can do anything in the name of celebrity status and with their money power. Supporting different looks and enticing the innocent people with their display of money has become a trend nowdays.

In this era, what we see is what we believe. Our young generation is taking our industry people as their role models. They have devalued our traditional cultures and respect for their elders that is why young ones are also arguing with their parents. These famous people must behave in a responsible manner towards the society. The yesteryear actors were so much dedicated towards their roles and how they  impact their generation in positive manner.

"Some people say that public sports facilities improve people health problems. Others argue that this development has insignificant effects on public health.
Discuss both views and give your opinion","Certain group of individuals claim that general sports facilites aids in resolving heath related issues. On the contrary, some people assume  that this approach has no considerable benefits on the human body. In my perspective, I believe it has huge significance in improving health which would be discussed in the upcoming paragraphs.

On the one hand, recreational centres such as gyms, swimming pools are plays a vital role innimproving well being of human .

So they hardly get somwtime for themselves to utilise the benefits of these places. In addition , there are many other sectors  of the society which  are needed to be improved to provide good health services to citizens such as hospitals.

"Topic: These days there are a lot of TV channels available to view. Some
people think it is good to have a range of options but others argue that it
affects the quality of programs.
Discuss both sides and give your opinion as well.","The increase in the number of TV channels has provoked a critical controversy over if these variety is valuable and provide a broad spectrum of chances for people to select, or this increase in quantity is accompaned with poor content.From my perspective, many of satalite programs and showes now have very low quality, despite the tremendous which is on the surface nowadays.

On the one hand, many people aurge that the approach of variety and huge number of programs gives those who watch TV the ability to choose freely bteween movis, talkshows, news, or even crtoon. Not only this, even in the same category there is specificialty, like different types of films' channels, while one is restricted for action, the other is limited to comedy. Also those people stand on the side of variety as the thought that highten people's intellect by huge amount of information about different aspects in life, such as scientific, sports and current world news.

However, I can see that these ideas are flawed owing to superfacial as well as directed thoughts they provide, programs' maneger are usually aiming to enforce their points of view on the viewer, to attract many observers to his side no matter they offer the truth or not. For instance, those who take the side of governement and encourage what they do all the time, while others who judge the behaviours of countries' presidents at any stage even at important and critical events that need all the citizens to be one hand.

"Some people think that art is an essential subject for children at school while others think it is a waste of time.
Discuss both views and give your opinion","People have different views about whether art should become one of important subjects for the youth or not. While many arguments assume that learning about art at school is time consuming, others are on the contradicting view. Personally, I would contend that art should be taught in optional courses.
On the one hand, there are some reasons for the idea of removing art classes from school’s schedule. One realistically cogent reason is that art is not an essential skill for life survival. People still can find a job and earn for living without an art talent. In fact, there are not many job opportunities for artists compared with other common sectors, hence, some parents would incline to equip their children with academic knowledge rather than art techniques so that kids’ future would be guaranteed with an easier and brighter career path. Therefore, it is not unreasonable for those who consider that spending time for these subjects is such a waste resulting in their intention of the cancellation.
On the other hand, there are some points of view that support the necessary of art courses in school. It can be seen that practicing art activities could develop the young generation’s creativities. Besides, initial art classes could help children explore their passion and ability, thereby gradually germinate and evolve their talent. Moreover, a few hours of learning art could be able to help children relax after other academic subjects.
However, to my mind, although there are both merits and drawbacks of art courses, they should not be completely removed or become an essential subject. I believe some kids enjoy doing art, others might feel uncomfortable. Hence, I would like to suggest that school can make these courses optional. It should depend on the youth to decide to participate in or not.
In conclusion, there are pros and cons for spending time for art in school, nevertheless, everyone deserve to freely make their own decision for how they spend in education stage.","## Task Achievement:

Some people believe that climate change has the greatest effect on people’s way of life. Others believe the economy of the region has the greatest effect. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.,"Many topics we can gain from newspapers or social media and climate change is one of them. Nowadays, plenty of people assume climate change can increase the temperature of the earth so it forces people to adapt with that situation. Furthermore, the economy in the place where we live also makes us adjust our lifestyle to be fit with our environment. 

Climate change has been a hot topic lately since it gives great impact on humans and the most noticeable problem is an increasing of earth temperature. In Indonesia for instance, people who live in Bandung, which is known as highland, need Air Conditioner (AC) and it's an adaptation done by humans to keep feeling cold. Climate change not only can affect temperature but also it makes messy weather schedule.This random weather creates new habits that are made so people can go their whole lives without being bothered by the weather.  Workers who always bring their umbrella and consume vitamins are behaviors that came from random weather problems.

People who live in Jakarta and people who live in Semarang surely has different lifestyles and it because the rate of economy there. Region where have high rate economy make sellers can sell their products with high price as they know people who live there can afford to buy it. Same way of selling can not applied in low rate economy region. That different makes people need to adjust their lifestyle to place where they live. For example, Semarang people only need Rp 10.000 to get Nasi Padang (Indonesia traditional food) but in Jakarta you need to spend as much money as Rp 15.000 to get the same food. Not only that, the economic rate in a region also give impact to the government about the tax rate. 

Either climate change and region economic rate can affect people’s live. In my own opinion climate change give more impact compared region economic rate since climate change could involve to world community but region economic rate only affects that region.","## Task Achievement:

Human activities have negative effects on plant and animal species . Some Human activities have negative effects on plant and animal species. Some people think it is too late to do anything about this problem. Others believe that effective measures can be taken to improve this situation. Discuss both views and give our opinion.,"Some actions of mankind have detrimental effects on flora and fauna. It is believed that there is no time for people to redress their mistakes while some people think that this circumstance can be effectively improved by various solutions. From my perspective, I have a strong belief that several measures can be taken to solve this problem.

To begin with, some people have right reasons to claim that it is an unsolvable problem and nothing can be done to deal with it. Deforestation or climate change caused by human activities is so destructive that it is placing many species’lives at risk. As a consequent, many species of plants and animals are dying due to loss of habitat and human’s hunt. Some of them have already become extinct, thus negatively affecting the balance of the ecosystem. For example, in Vietnam where there used to be a large number of tigers, this animal has been hunted for years to satisfy human’s needs and there are only few species left. 

However, I strongly argue that there are a lot of things that goverments and individuals can do to deal with this problem. Firstly, the issue of deforestation needs to be addressed. It is the main cause of the disapperance of endangered species around the world. Governments can plant more trees to create places for animals and plants to live and develop their population. Moreover, strict rules should be published to deter people from cutting down trees and hunting for precious animals and plants. Another solution is to raise awareness of residents about the destructive effects of our activities to the Earth and the ecosystem. Public talks and lectures about the possible consequences of mankind need to be hold in order to make the public aware of their activities. 

In conclusion, although some people think that there is nothing to solve this problem, I personally believe that there are many effective solutions to solve it. The protection of forest and the awareness of the public are really important in dealing with this issue.","**Task Achievement: 4**

Some people think that secondary school children should study international news as one of the school subjects. Other people think that it is a waste of valuable school time. What do you think? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"The never-ending debate of adding foreign news as one of the subjects of secondary school syllabus is not new. However, the news of overseas current affairs opens the doors for opportunities in indirect ways.   I believe that international news must be a part of the school syllabus for various useful reasons that will be discussed in this essay further. 

Since globalization has arrived and the internet has made everything clear, many students entail a lot of knowledge about world affairs. The growth of efficient organizations in developing countries is opening numerous opportunities for everyone. For example, technology innovations in a country like China are mindblowing, many engineers or technical students from developed countries wish to work in companies situated in China. All these news let the students explore what is going on in the world, and where they can be fitted. Moreover, we all are learning from each other; the success or failure of one country's economy is a lesson for others. For instance, a less peaceful country would look into the reforms of the most peaceful countries - i.e. Newzealand or Canada. Therefore, knowledge lets countries learn from each other. 

Measuring the other benefits; helps students to know about the areas on which the world is competing. Like sports, Television, E-sports and other activities that give countries get power and fame. For example, there are stories of heroes they share online that helps student boost their confidence and morale. Besides, it might help the students in different fields to explore information about their subjects. We can take an example of medical students who can gain knowledge of different disease testing equipment or methods that are used in developed countries. In short, obtaining overseas news opens the intellectual horizons and thoughts of students. 

To summarize, I would suggest that students should know what is happening around the world so that they should adapt to positive change in their life. In my opinion, international news lets students learn practically; whereas, bookish knowledge becomes hard to apply in practical life without examples.","**Task Achievement:**

Some people believe that the government should take care of old people and provide financial support after they retire. Others say individuals should save during their working years to fund their own retirement. What is your opinion? Give reasons for your answer and include examples from your own experience.,"There is a subject of controversy whether workers should put aside while working for their retirement or depend on pensions that they receive from the government. Both of these views will be discussed in this essay.
On the one hand, some people believe the government is responsible for pensions. Workers are considered as a crucial factor to determine one nation's success because they have devoted themselves to working as well as to the betterment of society. Hence, after retiring, they have a right to be provided with finance. For instance, in Vietnam, medical students spend over 6 years in university and keep on getting higher medical qualifications, then they are always on the run in the hospital while working to help patients and reduce the mean mortality rate. With these contributions, they deserve to receive financial support while retiring.
On the other hand, putting by on their own has some benefits. This could lessen the financial burden on government and more state budget will be used for improving other life aspects such as poverty in remote areas or education for the underprivileged. Moreover, having independent savings enable old people to be more active in having a well-fed life as well as let their offsprings not be worried about them. With savings, retired workers could pursue their own hobbies and improve their spiritual life such as fishing with old friends or treated themselves a vacation.
In conclusion, although the government takes responsibility to provide pensions, saving for retirement let old people be more active in their life.","## Task Achievement:

"Experts believe that over the next decade, robots will be doing many of the jobs currently done by humans.

Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this.","From last two decades advancement in techonology grows drastically, that day is not far when its gonna replace humans everywhere. This improvement will introduce its own pros and cons that I will discuss in following paragraphs.

To begin with benefits, robots will be quicker because if same job is assigned to an indvidual and a machine it will be apparent second one will finish the wrok faster. for example,, to build a five stroy bulding genral labour will take atleast two years but when its replaced by robots it will be only the matter of few weeks. Therefore, this replacement will save time. Moreover, quality of work will be improved significantly. As when human beings perform chors its less likely to be error free as compared to technology. According to the study at the Oxford university the automated car tesla avoid 90% of the accidents that human drivers cannot.

Moving towards the drawbacks firstly, will cause unemployement when most taks will be completed by mechanical beings then folks will be jobless. For instance, Kiosk machiens at retaurants replaced the cashiers. Secondloy it will produce unhealthy society because people will always relay on robots to do even basic things like, having a cup of water or swithing off lights from bed these will result to no physical avtivities and will make society lazy.

Human activities have negative effects on plants and animal species. Some people think that it is too late to do anything about this problem. Other people believe that effective measures can be taken to improve this situation. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"Human being has always been abusing the mother earth since the industrial revolution. Almost every kind of environmental problem or animal distinction, are the negative result of human activities. Some people believe that we can still save our planet and immediate actions must be taken. Others think that these actions are just grasping at straws. In my opinion, both approaches are equally reasonable, but personal statements vary.

Some people believe that we can take proactive approaches to save plants and animals. For example, panda has once been taken as dangerous distinctive species, but with the effort of many zoologists, pandas are being transfered to a much safer environment, such as the zoo, witch can insure the conservation of them. Now, we can see pandas in zoos all around the world, the number of pandas are surely secured.

On the other hand, some people say that such actions can never keep up with the damages made by human. Some disruptions are irreversible, like the ozone hole, it takes centuries for it to recover. Before that, animals and plants may suffer from drought and forest fire. Moreover, according to Darwin’s Natural Selection, it is quite natural for animals to die out. Dinosaurs become extinct because of the volcano explosion, and it is unnatural to preserve them or even bring them back to life. We surely don’t want to see such horrible nightmares like the movie Jurassic Park to happen in real life.

In conclusion, some people nowadays engage in environmental events, and devoted themselves to protect the living creatures on earth. While some only take passive actions. I believe that although there are chances that these protective actions are useless, we should’t give up on doing so. If we don’t give it a try, we will never know what we can accomplish.","**Task Achievement:** 5.5

"Some people believe that eventually all jobs will be done by artificially intelligent robots, what is your opinion?","At present time, there have been many intelligent robots that can be able to work as same as humans do. Although, some might say that people are into and can be more practical, some argue that a smart invention is totally accurate. I strongly believe that we should intrigate between humankind and robots because both of them have its pros and cons. This essay will explore the benefits and some drawbacks in following paragraphs.

As nowadays there are a number of artificial intelligent robots involve in many industries for a few advantages. One of these is they provide more accurate and precise processing than human. For example, there is a medical robotic machine which helps pharmacist to prepare the tablets for their patients and the medical errors are rarely found  when compared to providing medicine without helping of intelligent machanical inventions.

In contrast, a person can do some task better than a robotic invention, such as cooking in the high class restaurant as the fantastic meals need to be done by a sophisticated chief who can put and test the best ingradient in a hot pot for their customers. Nevertheless, a worker need to get paid for their insurance and other welfares while a robot does not need anythings like humans do.

To conclude, there are advantages and disadvantages both of these of them. A company should wisely make a dicision before choosing and consider which one is more worth or they can apply both of them in order to make more profits. Moreover, the most crucial is they can afford it. I believe that the organizations could earn more income if they opt a smart option.","### Task Achievement

"Some people believe that eventually all jobs will be done by artificially inetligent robots.

What is your opinion?","In these modern days, people think that AI will rapidly increase to replace our jobs. I believe our technology has developed diverse opinions and it will be taking over from what we created, robots.

In the past, skill was a necessary qualification for any occupation, and any type of job had to be done manually by humans such as an accountant or an analyzer. This type of employee has to be very intelligent and concentrated in their job, if there is any error it would cause the accuracy and damage the company's reputation.

Conversely, an intelligent robot can be represented as a computer and a human because of their accuracy and faster response to our needs. For example, auto-clean machines can be used for any type of household, human only need to click an app from their smartphone, and it will automatically start their job. It not only saves time but also saves money to hire someone to tidy the house.

In conclusion, even though the human is the one who invents robots, we forget this development will change our living society and the innovative machine will also replace our job placement.","**Task Achievement:** 4.5

Some people believe that eventually all jobs will be done by artificially intelligent robots.,"Artificially intelligent robots are progressively replacing humans in the workforce. While it is possible that all menial jobs will eventually done by robots, it is unlikely that jobs that require human contact will be taken over. This essay will discuss why eventually only very few jobs will be carried out by people.

Robots may eventually replace all human labour that does not require specific and complex human skills. Many companies will turn to artificial intelligence because it is far less expensive than hiring, training and employing a human. In supermarkets in Australia, for example, many cashiers have been replaced by automated stations that cost far less than employees. In addition, these automated stations work around the clock and require no holidays or holiday pay. For these reasons, jobs that can be replaced by robotic intelligence will be replaced.

Conversely, there are some human jobs that cannot be replaced because robots will never achieve the capacity to do them. Put simply, some jobs require a 'human touch'. These jobs include psychology, education, medicine and social work to name but a few. Robots will never be able to achieve what has taken social evolution hundreds of thousands of years to achieve.

It is increasingly likely that robots will end most human employment. Unskilled labour will eventually be done entirely by robots; however sophisticated jobs that require human specific skills will always exist. Ultimately, few jobs will be safe in an increasingly artificial intelligent workforce.","**Task Achievement:**

"In many countries, people decide to have children at a later age than in the past. Why? Do the advantages of this development outweigh the disadvantages? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","These days, many couples opt for delayed childbirth. This trend can be attributed to career priorities. From my point of view, I consider that it has more drawbacks, especially the health of their offspring.

On the one hand, postponing parenthood can bring about significant advantages. Firstly, parents have financial stability after concentrating completely on their career. Therefore, children may receive a better education quality in a precious school. In addition, when pregnant at a later age, couples are more mature in emotional aspect, so their spouse relationship can become more stable. Furthermore, they would be ready to take care of their children. For instance, children who were born in families by elderly parents tend to be paid more attention than others since their parents have more family time.

On the other hand, embarking on parenthood at a later age can have unexpected disadvantages. First of all, that can increase the generation gap between parents and their offspring, leading to familial conflicts. In terms of the long run side, parents may not be around for as long as their children need them. Moreover, babies in such families are susceptible to mental diseases due to gene fault. As a case in point, according to health-related studies, infants who were born by mothers over 35 years old are prone to Down syndrome.

To sum up, opting for pregnancy at a later age can be because of heightened monetary burdens. That brings certain pros and cons about health and family aspects. From my perspective, the disadvantages should be given more concern than advantages.","**Task Achievement: 5.5**

"The best way to teach children to cooperate is through team sports at school, to what extent do you agree or disagree?","It has been a topic of debate about how best to teach children teamwork, and the debate remains open to this day. Many people believe that team sports is the best way to achieve this goal. But, in my opinion, there are better solutions than this method.

Firstly, team sports at school can teach children important values such as teamwork and communication. By being in the communication circle with other pupils, they develop their social skills. Because not only one player or member of the team can win a game or competition. They should work together and understand each other for achieving the goal. Additionally, playing team sports brings students more happiness than individual sports and helps them make new friends, which can motivate them to collaborate with others in the future.

On the other hand, other methods such as working in groups to solve a practical problem are also effective in increasing students' cooperative spirit. For example, many schools have multiple interdisciplinary programs that require team members who are proficient in different subjects. Without joint efforts, children will never be able to reach a satisfactory solution. As a result, they will understand how important it is to collaborate and learn from each other. Meanwhile, students working in these collaborative projects will also find collaboration beneficial as it can improve their problem-solving skills and improve their knowledge of all subjects involved.

In conclusion, although playing team sports is good for helping children learn the importance of cooperation, I think teachers can come up with better ways to encourage their students to work together.","### Task Achievement:

Some people believe that teenagers should be required to do unpaid community work in their free time. This can benefit teenagers and the community as well. To what extent do you agree or disagree.,"having the opportunity to work at a young age is very beneficial in the future. many people think youngsters should do unpaid jobs, hence this leads to more benefits for teenagers and the community. which to some extent I disagree with this belief.

firstly , expecting the young population to do the unpaid tasks is unthoughtful , for instance, these days because of school they already have enough tasks to do that they barely have free time , so imagine making them  do unpaid jobs at those limited times . as a result, many of them might lose themselves to this amount of pressure.

on the other hand , working at these ages can improve many skills in them which they can use in their future ,also it can teach them how can a workplace be and how should they behave and perform with other people. moreover , these works give benefits to the society and the community in which they live and improve the quality of their neighborhood .in addition working without expecting to get money can make them understand doing some tasks is just for a better feeling and not for the money can opens their eye to immaterial world and changes the way they’re viewing the world. 

to sum up , there are many benefits to this work but it shouldn’t be forced on teenagers because not every person's situation is the same. but it also can be useful for the community that they live in  raise the quality of their life and make changes in many things.","**Task Achievement:**

"Some think that governments should support retired people financially while others believe they should take care of themselves.


Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","Retired people have been increasing in numbers, nowadays. This stage of life is believed to be given support financially by the government, however, there are others who think that they need to finance their needs and should not expect any government assistance. Both of these views need to be discussed further as I believed that these retired individuals are important members of the society and should be given support from authorities for as long as they need them. 


Many of the retired people are receiving pensiones from their previous work in different sectors that offered insurance policy. This financial support sometimes comes from the government’s insurance system if they had worked for the government sector such as public teachers, soldiers, and other government office employees. In this regard, it is axiomatic that the government should support retired people because they had rendered service for a period of time.


Meanwhile, there are retired people who were not able to establish financial security at their old age. These are the ones who worked menial jobs, or unfit to work at all. In this case, there are government authorities who make sure that these individuals are taken care of under a social service unit. Rendering care to these people is a government responsibility in order to build a humane society. 


However, a part of the society is not keen on the idea of government helping the retired ones. This is due to the fact that some of them are still physically and mentally able to work. Others also claim that their families, especially children should take responsibility for financing their needs. For instance, in Filipino culture, the elderly are well supported by their family members and some children even include them in their paid insurances, such as medical care. 


All these being said, the government needs to allocate budget for social services to retired persons who do not have any support from private sectors or their own families. These retired members of the society have rendered in their own way a service to their nation and thus should be respected and supported in their needs.","## Task Achievement:

"Some people believe that eventually all jobs will be done by artificially intelligent robots. 
What is your opinion?","Some may argue that in the future all human workforces will be replaced by robots. While it is possible that most low skill jobs will be taken over by artificial intelligent computers, it is still difficult for some area of work to fully rely on them. This essay will discuss why in the end humans are still needed to do many other jobs.

First, the majority of the non-complex occupation will be handle by robot in the future. It simply because, robot can be easily programmed to do a constant and simple job, moreover, companies will try their best to limit the salary expense by hiring more robots to replace the non-essential workforce. In Indonesia for example, they already started to create an automatic payment gate in every toll-roads. In addition, this automatic gate now being implemented and more common to be found as an exit gate in the parking area. For these reasons, ,eventually many low-level jobs will be replaced by robot in the future.

On the other hand, there are a lot of specific jobs that utterly cannot be substituted by another thing but human.  This condition applies because that kind of work often needs the intervere of the human brain as decision-makers. Doctors for instance, need to analyse many aspects of patients before taking actions and receipt of proper medicines. That kind of complex decision-making process is very unique and robot will not be able to compete with humans.

In conclusion, even though in the future robot might take over many kinds of job, there are still numerous jobs that will never be replaced by it, more specifically jobs that involving the decision-making process. Ultimately, the increasing number of robots as work labourers are an inevitability and only a few jobs will incompatible for them.","**Task Achievement:**

"Many university graduates cannot find a job in their chosen profession. What factors may have caused this situation and what, in your opinion, should be done about it?","When young people are choosing what subject to study at university, most of them hope they will find a great job upon graduation. In reality many fresh graduates fail to find work in their field and some are even forced to take up a below graduate level job. In my opinion, the root of this problem lies in the outdated higher education system that should be modernized.
Traditional university education does not prepare students for their first job for a number of reasons. One of them is that many programmes are too theoretical. It means that highly educated graduates lack simple skills required for employment, for example, the knowledge of IT software. Employers, therefore, prefer candidates with hands-on experience. Another reason is that universities offer too many courses in popular fields, such as business and law, and do not recruit enough students for engineering and science programmes. As a result, the UK labour market has an oversupply of law graduates and a deficit of engineers. 
A reform of higher education could alleviate many of the problems but would require joint efforts from universities and the government. If universities worked closer with employers, they could teach students practical skills that companies look for. Meanwhile, the government could develop guidelines on how many students universities should recruit in each subject in accordance with the market demand.
In conclusion, a likely reason why many graduates cannot find a job in their field is because university education might not have provided them with the right skill set or an in-demand profession. I think that universities and the government could improve the situation by updating the content of the programmes and limiting the number of students in each subject in line with the market demand.","**Task Achievement: [5.5]**

"Some people think that public health of a country can be improved if the government make laws regarding nutritious food but others think that it is the matter of personal choice and personal responsibility. Discuss both views and give your opinion.
","Nowadays, healthcare condition is becoming more and more essential to each individual. Some people argue that the government should take measures to improve health of their citizens by imposing food laws. Others believe that everyone has responsible for their own health. This essay will discuss both points of view before coming to a reasoned conclusion.

On the one hand, in fact governments play a critical role to ensure well-being of their citizens. First of all, governments are responsible for the quality and safety of food in the market, they could introduce strict laws to make sure that public heath will not be damaged by polluted or expired food. Moreover, using unauthorized chemicals, selling unhygienic and low-quality food should be forbidden by the government. For example, eating fast food may lead to severe diseases such as increase in blood cholesterol, raise blood pressure and obesity. In some countries, the government imposes a high tax on junk food with the objective of discouraging its consumption. All of these are measures that can have a positive impact on public health.

On the other hand, in my opinion healthy lifestyle is a choice and habit of an individual, each person should hold accountable for their health, and the government cannot monitor the lifestyle of every citizen.  For instance, if people follow a sedentary lifestyle such as eating junk food, being a potato couch, being ignorant to break their bad habit and so on, they will surely suffer from physical health issues. However, the government cannot do much to help these people. Furthermore, the choices of individuals greatly affect the overall health condition of a nation. Thus, each person should choose more suitable food according to their own physical conditions, and retain a kind of good eating habit for long term so as to have a healthier lifestyle.

In shorts, there are several reasons for health problem, and I strongly believe that both governments and individuals should join hands to improve the situation.

"Some people think that the main purpose of schools is to turn children into good citizens and workers, rather to benefit them as individuals. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","These days, some people are assuming that institutions are used for children only purchase to be a good citizens and workers. However, Education can be a most valuable thing for every human being to become a knowledgeable person and use it in so many ways that can give themselves more beneficial than imagine. In this essay, i will discuss both sides of the view and provide my overall opinion.

Generally speaking, there are two main reasons is now believing that it can only use in to be a good person and worklife. Firstly, schools are made for human, where people can taken good things. To be precise, Education gives the real meaning of life what exactly children needs to do in their upcoming times, either they take it or waste their time on wasted area.For example, by taking good morality from schools are able to know what are goods and bads, so they can make difference on that. Secondly, children are going to do hard working to get success. This is because, if children wants to live a better life then have to do as much hard work they didn't. Proof themselves as a best workers in their corporate life, so that they can chance to enhance their position and salary.

On the other hand, there is a case for the idea that not only help on those areas but also children are going to fullfil their uncomplete wishes that they hadn't got in their child age. Unlike in the past, children are now getting access all of the facilities they want, so they can use their didactic knowledge with that resourses are going to build something that can produce best outcome for them and world as well.In addtion, children who are gifted they can be a businessman, show some creativity in their little life to become more polpular or be a sucessfull person.

Some believe that people are naturally born leaders while others feel that leadership skills can develop. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"There is a tremendously controversial prospective heating up a debate the origin of the leadership. While some people hold a strong view that it is a natural skill, the opposites make a statement that a person can become a leader through the experience as well as the knowledge. This essay will discuss both point of view and my personal opinion about this phenomenon

Evidently, a wealth of people are naturally born leaders since they own the strong characteristics to become a leader such as being outgoing person, gregarious and full of energy. All these personality traits help the leader to manage, to gather people together and to inspire and motivate them. Vladimir Putin, a president of Russia can be cited as an outstanding example that he natural born political leader who inspires many people with his boundless professional abilities, charisma and display astounding skills. Hence, being sociable, charisma and having strong traits are important natural skills for being a chief.

Although the leadership skill is one of natural skills, I still belive that it can be built and enhanced.  There are a bunch of elements that make someone a great leader, such as discipline and resourcefulness, which can definitely be developed through one's upbringing and life period. For instance, to become a pioneer as well as a president of Vietnam, Hochiminh had to spent three decades in this life on travelling around the world and  acquire the knowledge from developed nations in this time to find an ideal way to lead our country. Therefore, beside a natural skill, leadership can be developed by the experience in life. 

In conclusion, although a strong leader's talents and traits are both genetic and can be improved by training, observation, and a lot of hard work, there are many people born without natural leadership skills who can still become good leaders thank to their attemption.","## Task Achievement: [Band Score: 6.5]

"Some people think that museums should be enjoyable places to entertain people,
while others believe that the purpose of museums is to educate.
Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","These days, public debate has been going on over whether museums should amuse or enlighten humans. Both viewpoints can be grounded with compelling arguments, which are key for understanding the reasons behind conflict and can broaden one’s horizons, therefore, will be analyzed.

To embark on, a pleasurable experiences in museums would have a range of benefits for the society. To start with, a higher attendance of the institutions would be provoked. For this reason, more tickets would be bought and higher sums of money collected. The financial savings could be used for virtuous purposes when, for example, state museums would give them to the government. The latter undeniably has a dozen of opportunities for investment, including social projects that increase the welfare of the country. Moreover, some museums might become a cheap option for entertainment. If more people can afford the latter, they will have more opportunities for unwinding themselves. Undoubtedly, relaxing and resting after a workday is indispensable for being productive the next day. Eventually, workers could produce more value for their land or environment with their work. 

	But the assertion that museums should serve the purpose of teaching people, has convincing justifications too. One of them is that the facilities could evoke curiosity about the culture along with traditions of a land. This may catalyze the development of national pride and patriotism. Consequently, individuals pursuing such values would get motivated and have an incentive to collaborate, work hard for the nations well-being and promote peace in their surroundings for achieving that. Furthermore, expositions might spark curiosity about some subjects. As a result, there would be more young personas inspired about science, hence, interested in studying. If they learned more, they would acquire more skills for possibly inventing something in the future. If it would turn out to be so, the inventions could help the society like electricity does.

	This leads to the conclusion that making museums a place, which is fun to come to, and utilizing them for enlightening members of the society has a multitude of merits. On the basis of the above discussion it might not be clear for what one should opt for, however, it may be manageable somehow for museums to fulfill both needs and solutions for that should be sought after.","**Task Achievement:**

some people  think that robots are very important to humans future development  while others think they are dangerous and have negative effects on society . discuss both views and give your opinion,"Some argue that machines with artificial intelligence are critical to improving people's futures, while others argue that the invention of robots is a risk that can have negative consequences for society.I believe robots are crusial becouse without robots we cannot be achive the production that is required.

In many countries, robots have become crucial to the development of the economy as they engage in not only manufacturing but also service industries. Robots can survive in conditions that humans cannot, for example,roots are working in a mining area where the air contains poisonous gases and they extract valuable resouse to use for human  . In addition, automated machines are used in car manufacturing because they can work long hours continuously and, in most cases, are more effective than humans.Therefore, global productivity has increased significantly, which is good for future human development. I believe this is a great advantage of robots.

On the other hand, robots can be used in military and anti-social tasks such as causing harm to people and other tasks because the machines only obey their owner's rules and may not consider human feelings or other humans' values.

"Some people believe that children at school should learn art, others says it is a waste of time. What is your opinion?","Today's, music, dancing and painting fields are equally important as any other fields. Some believe that teenagers should learn art at an early age, while others would say that It is waste of time as well as money. This essay strongly agrees with Children should learn the art field because It increases their creativity and develops their minds. 

The primary reason students learn arts is that It improves their problem-solving skills. This is because If they learn painting and many more arts improve their mental abilities as well as develop their mind as well. For instance, a study conducted by American Management School found that around 60 per cent of teenagers who learn arts they are well performed in maths subjects because of their problem-solving abilities. 

Another reason is that they are more creative than any other children. Arts means creativity and if schools teach artists so, teenagers improve their creativity at an early stage. For example, an article published by BBC news showed that approximately 30 per cent of students learn arts at their starting days more creative than any others students.

"Some people think that instead of preventing climate change, we need to find a way to live with it. To what extent do you agree or disagree?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Climate change is one of the most essential topics in today’s world. Accordingly, there are many approaches in order to solve this major problem. While there are some people who consider climate change as something that can be lived with, others give it extreme importance and look for powerful solutions for its prevention. I strongly believe that this severe issue is something to be dealt with. For that reason, we must take individual actions and force governments to act in accordance with necessary precautions.

First and foremost, I must state that raising awareness and commencing individual action constitutes the most effective part considering the prevention of the alterations in the climate. Specifically, individual action forms a cumulative organization due to its nature. To illustrate, decreasing the frequency of using automobiles and aircraft makes a considerable difference in terms of the continuing process of climate change. Clearly, it provides low waste of gas which spreads to the air. 

Second, after taking individual action, people must cajole governments into taking relevant measures for the elimination of possible outcomes of this matter. Furthermore, all around the world, governments are initiating and managing investments with a plethora of other governments or private companies in order to maintain economic development. However, the irresponsible behaviour of politicians in monetary terms harms the future of young generations. Therefore, to exemplify, people must force governments not to make investments in fossil fuel and sectors that cause high carbon emissions.

In conclusion, the tendency of living with climate change and not trying to stop its negative effects in the environment should never be the policy of any country. We absolutely cannot just live with it. Instead, everybody must comply with the rules and regulations set forth under respected institutions and non-governmental organizations for avoiding the consequences of it. By taking individual steps and pressuring governments, we can get positive results and leave a clean and viable earth for the next generations.","**Task Achievement: [6]**

Some people think competitive sport is important for a child’s education. Others think it has negative effects on children. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"An increasing number of people are concerned about the purpose of teaching sports at schools. Many people believe that schools should offer competitive sports in a curriculum, while others are against it because it may negatively affect children. In my opinion, I would argue that competitive sports should not be allowed at schools as they may bring many drawbacks to children.

It is a belief that competitive sports bring many advantages for children in the future. First, competition is a natural instinct in humans, and it is likely to strengthen children’s personalities. Therefore, competition is healthy because it pushes people to give their best or even over their limitation. Second, children need to experience these competitions at schools. This is due to the fact that when they graduate from schools, they have to step into the real world where people have to compete with one another to get jobs in daily life.

On the other hand, the negative effects of competitive sports should not be overlooked. The first reason is that sports should provide children with a sense of enjoyment rather than competition. Addionally, playing sports with their peers can build their relationships and teamwork skills. If competitive sports are brought to the curriculum, their relationships will be disjointed and fragmented. Another consideration is that playing sports encourages children to have physical and mental development, meaning that they become healthier and may have fewer diseases, such as diabetes. Whereas competitive sports may make them feel stressed because they have to against one another for higher grades.

In conclusion, sports are great activities for children’s development. Personally, I believe that competition in schools brings more harm than benefits.","**Task Achievement:**

"In some countries, more and more people are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the house or building they live in. 
What are the reasons for this?
How can people research this?","Real estate buyers are becoming more interested in past information of the building they are buying, which is a common trend around the world. It seems to me that there are two main reasons, including safety concern and psychological belief and several ways to investigate the history of a house.

Firstly, researching a home`s past allows people to make sure about its architectural history for preservation purposes. For example, it is essential to know when it was built, what it is built of, what changes had been made, or how it was used before. This detailed information can help meet the security requirements of the owners so that they can know exactly what changes and repairs need to be made. Secondly, understanding the history of the house in which you live is one of the reasons to live happily. No one wants to live in a house where some dreadful events had happened, such as murder or violence.  

Tracing the history of old houses could be more challenging than contemporary houses. However there can be several ways to explore the history. First, using internet seems possible to compile initial facts since a wide range of records are becoming more available online today. Official websites can be more reliable and provide information on resources and where to find them. Second, information on the history of houses or buildings can be obtained from local authorities, such as National Archives and Property Registry. In addition, real estate realtors should be able to assist the purchasers with finding the basic information, like previous owners.

In conclusion, it appears that feeling satisfied and safe in the house we live in is a reason to discover its history, and online resources and local authorities could be the main source of the information.","## Task Achievement:

"Some people believe that eventually all jobs will be done by artificial robots. What is your opinion?

Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant example from your knowledge or experience. Write at least 250 words.","Nowadays, some people assume that occupations might be substituted progressively by artificial robots in the future. In my opinion, although a majority of simple jobs will be done by robots ultimately, it is impossible that positions which require human relations can be replaced. This essay will discuss the reasons why only particular jobs will be finally taken over.

Without a doubt, artificial robots will easily overtake the jobs that do not require specific and complex human skills in the workforce. From a cost point of view, many companies will choose to use artificial intelligence because it is far less expensive than training and employing a human. Cashiers in supermarket, for instance, are gradually being replaced by checkout machines that cost far less than employees. Customers can easily pay for their goods by using self-checkout facilities rather than standing in a long queue to wait for services at a counter. For these reasons, using artificial robots can be a significantly effective way for companies. 

Conversely, there are some complicated human jobs that will never be overtaken by robotic intelligence because robots do not have the capacities to achieve. In other words, some particular occupations require complex and critical thinking that only human brain can do. For example, science-related jobs, such as doctors, scientists, pharmacists, engineers, can only be carried out by the professionals, even in the future. Robots will not be able to sort out all of the problems which need to be overcome by human. 

In conclusion, with the development of advanced technology, it is no doubt that robots have the abilities to replace a significant number of occupations in the near future. Unskilled labour will eventually be done by machines entirely; however, some sophisticated fields that require specific and complicated human skills will always exist. Consequently, occupations in particular professional areas will be safe in an increasingly artificial intelligent world.","**Task Achievement:**

"Many people believe that the priority of the government should be to ensure a growing economy. While others believe that the government should focus its efforts on uplifting the less fortunate?
Discuss both views.","A section of the society are ardent believers in government pursuing economic growth as a primary objective. However, the others opine that the government should channelize its efforts on increasing the standards for the under-privileged. Hence, this essay will evaluate both the views of the society. 

On the one hand, having an expanding economy is indispensable in uplifting the living standards of the economy. Firstly, a growing country signifies the increasing amount of output produced. To produce more, one needs a lot of human resources(labour). As a result, unemployment drops in the economy as jobs are created and people have a stable income in order to lead a peaceful and prosperous life. For instance, CNBC reported India’s growing economy has improved their quality of life drastically in the last decade. 

On the other hand, focusing on elevating the poorer section of the society induces a positive outlook of the economy which stimulates tourism. It is often seen not having a poverty-stricken society boosts the number of travellers to that country. Furthermore, tourists opine that they are disinterested and discontented to perceive an environment which has a low quality of life as the particular nation don’t possess the capability of satisfying their needs and wants. For example, a survey released by the CNA revealed that countries living in poverty demotivates tourists to travel to these nations

"In some countries, people encourage students to find part-time jobs while some people don't. Discuss both sides and give your opinion.","In the contemporary epoch,there is irrefutable debate among folks  about part-time jobs for graduates.In certain countries,individuals inspire learners to find part-time employment while others do not advocate for it. I firmly coincide with and withstand the stated notion that it will expose the student in the line of the employment environment.This discourse will further elucidate my assertion in the forthcoming paragraph.

Firstly,this kind of exposure is very advantagious to the young stars although the society is not really for it.They end up practising what they are taught in lecture rooms as a results the gain experience and get exposure particularly in their area of interest.Moreover,work experience can help them land their dream job because most recruiters prefer to employ individuals with some experience.For example,a research done by kepsa(2020) depicts that 90% of employer prefer to give a job to people who have gone for an internship which help them as they do not take long to adapt to the system.Consequently,it is imperative for school-going people to undertake part-time attachment.

On the other hand,this can be detrimental since it can bring some disruption in the study although the student understands and retain more when they practice what they are taught in the classroom.Furthermore ,the scholar is not in a position to prepare for exams or even attend group discussion with others as there are duties allocated to them by the employer.For example,a research done by  the University of Nairobi depicts that part-time jobs for finalists make them drop out of school.Therefore,a certain individual does not advise pupils to work as it affects their performance as well as some end up dropping out of the academy

Historical objects should be brought back to their country of origin. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Historical objects are precious items that carry immense cultural and historical significance. They offer valuable glimpses into the past and act as tangible connections to our ancestry and heritage. According to a belief, it is crucial to repatriate these valuable treasures and preserve them in their original homeland. In this essay, I will elaborate on my strong agreement with this notion and shed light on my support for this subject.

Primarily, artefacts carry significant historical and cultural value for the people of a nation. For instance, the Koh-I-Noor diamond, once part of India's rich heritage, is now housed in the United Kingdom's Crown Jewels collection. Returning the Koh-I-Noor to India would be a meaningful gesture, as it holds deep cultural and historical importance for the Indian people. Consequently, it would allow them to reconnect with their past and preserve a piece of their heritage for future generations.

Furthermore, repatriating historical objects can play a crucial role in strengthening the nation's identity and pride. For example, The Sultan Ganj Buddha, an ancient bronze statue discovered in Bihar, is currently displayed in the Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery in the United Kingdom. Returning the Sultan Ganj Buddha to India would be an opportunity to celebrate and appreciate Indian history and spirituality. Hence, having artefacts back in their original context could help  people develop a deeper understanding of their culture and traditions.

In conclusion, having engaged in the subject matter, while displaying the artefacts in foreign museums may offer educational benefits to people worldwide, we should consider the special significance of these objects to the people of their nation. Therefore, I strongly support the idea that historical objects should be bought back to their country of origin as it can help preserve the rich heritage and foster a stronger sense of national identity and pride.","**Task Achievement:**

Young people are often influenced in their behaviours and situations by others in the same age. This is called “peer pressure”. Do the disadvantages of peer pressure outweigh the advantages?,"It is true that peer pressure has been a phenomenon, defining the influence of young people on their friends of the same age. In my view, its disadvantages do not outweigh the advantages. 

To begin with, peer pressure brings numerous disadvantages. One of the undeniable reasons is the career comparison among people, which became popular nowadays. The fact that some could become successful early and others may not due to the difference in their chosen majors; therefore, having a career compared is not a good idea that might get us uncomfortable. A good example of this is the rate of depression in the youth, some feel stressed out while being involved in comparing with others’ success. 

In addition, young people could copy the bad habits of churlish friends such as smoking or drinking wine too much; from that, effecting negatively on their health. 

Despite having limitations, peer pressure actually has some significant benefits, which would be a good friendship. It is true that everyone needs someone with whom to share  happiness and sorrows. Furthermore, young persons can learn vital skills such as leadership or good communication by encouraging each other. Therefore, it is a great way to help in sorting out difficulties in their life and develop their career together. This is particularly the case for the Nobel prize, many people working together to achieve the title is better than acting alone. 

In short, I advocate that although peer pressure has both pros and cons, we should consider its advantages to live comfortably while eliminating any unnecessary limitations with no doubt.","**Task Achievement:**

Some people believe that the government should not spend money on international aid when they have their own disadvantaged people like homeless and unemployed. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Over the last 100 years, population has grown at an exponential rate across many countries in the world. This brings along with it its own problems such as poverty, illiteracy, unemployment and so on. Many governments allocate huge resources to tackle these problems. Since all governments have problems to solve in their own countries, I agree with the argument that their first priority should be their own people.

There are ample reasons why I believe that the government should put the welfare of its own people ahead of others. To begin with, financial resources are becoming scarce and many countries are already in debt. These funds must be reserved for the development and maintenance of its own institutions and social security measures such as free health care and shelters for homeless people. Secondly, such welfare schemes not only elevate people out of poverty; they also help the government indirectly by creating jobs. This, in turn, facilitates the economic growth of the country.

On the other hand, it is understandable and reasonable to donate money to the poorer nations as a gesture of basic human decency and humanity. No nation, after all, can live in prosperity when its neighbours are struggling with poverty. By offering financial assistance to their poor neighbours, countries can also put a curb on illegal immigration. Even so, in my opinion, solving problems in one’s own country is more important than venturing to help others. Others should be helped only when the donating country has a surplus of money and resources.

In conclusion, there are obvious benefits for the government in the long run from donating money as relief aids to many foreign countries. However, I strongly iterate that the government must first improve the economic, financial and employment prospects of its own people before embarking on humanitarian work abroad.","## Task Achievement:

"It is generally observed that almost all high level jobs are done by men.Does it mean that the government should encourage a certain percentage of these jobs to be observed for women?
Do you agree or disagree with this proposition?","Nowadays, a great deal of attention has been paid to gender equality. Some people insist that government should quote the percentage of men and women who engage in managing jobs. I strongly agree with the idea because gender inequality is a severe problem in this contemporary world, and it is difficult to solve this without support from the government.

To begin with, the first reason why I support this is that there is a huge gap between males and females at workplaces. In fact, men more likely to be promoted than women in Japan. Japan is ranked 121st out of 150 countries regarding Gender Gap Index in 2020, and there are 10 per cent of female who play important role at office. This is because men have been jacked up the scores for a long time, and this is not because women inferior to man.

Another reason why I believe the government have better observe high-level positions for females is that society needs legal force. In general, managing positions are dominated by men in Japan. As a result, women struggle to be promoted and become executives. Traditionally, seniors do not think women become a member of society, since it had been considered that the greatest success as a woman is to become a housewife and raise children. Hence, it is easier to direct gender equality for companies when the government set a rule.

To conclude, I reiterate my complete agreement with the topic. This is because unfairness among men and women is the critical problem, and it quote is vital to enforce companies to put women at higher positions.","**Task Achievement:**

"more people decided to have childreb in their later age than in the past, why? 

Do advantages of this outweigh disadvantages ?","In this cutting-edge era, a number of individuals preferred to have infants at a later age as compared to the past. Undoubtedly, the pros of having children at a later age clearly outweigh its cons. This essay will discuss both pros and cons of this trend in the forthcoming paragraphs.

There are a few disadvantages of having little ones in the latter age. The predominant one is that at a later age, parents are not able to care for their children in an effective way as at that age they would not be physically well. They face numerous difficulties in order to care for their children. Moreover, if they are not physically good, they could not be able to give birth to children.

"Some people believe that studying at university or college is the best route to a successful career, while others believes that it is better to get a job straight after school. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","Education is one of the most crucial parts of people's lives. Some people are firm believers in getting higher education before working. Others, however, have shown intense devotion to getting a job. This essay will discuss both points of views and explain my opinion.

The first and most obvious one is gaining specific knowledge. There are many professions requiring specific academics such as doctor, lawyer and accountant which the school did not have in a syllabus. Thus, these kinds of curriculum have to be learned in the colledge. Moreover, the difference between university and school is self-study. The rationale behind this is that students have to do research by themselves by data-gathering and synthesising sources.

On the other hand, some people believe in direct working. This is an account of the more they work the more soft-skill they get, so these people will have more experience in working compared to the one in the same age. A great example for this can be seen that artists do not require a college diploma or entrepreneurs can learn by trying and making a lot of mistakes.

In conclusion, there are several benefits both in future study and going straight to work. From my perspective, working or internship before learning at university is the best solution. This is an account of ensuring the passion that they have to spend less of their life. According to research from a local university, it indicates that more than 40 percent of learners are not satisfied with their faculty leading to lack of passion to study. However, the students who have internships before  learning are eager to learn and tend to be successful in their future life.","**Task Achievement:**

"Some people think the best way to solve environmental problems is to increase the cost of fuel for cars and other vehicles.
To what extent, do you agree or disagree?
","It is commonly believed by many that inflating the cost of fuel is the most efficient way to solve environmental issues. I partially agree with them because I believe that although it is an important way but there are many other more effective ways of doing so.

On one hand, increase in the rate of fuel would definitely reduce the level of pollution to some extent. As increased rate will discourage people to use their vehicles unnecessarily, as it is a common trend to drive a car even though the distance is walkable. This will encourage people to use pooling of vehicle while going to same site. For instance, if five people from one community work in same office or location, it is the efficient to go by one car alternatively. This will also motivate them to use bicycles and public transport system. Thus, this will solve the problem to some extent.

On the other hand, I believe this is not the key method and there are many other effective ways to solve environmental issues such as growing more trees and avoid use of plastic bags. Plastic containers should be replaced by bio-degradable glass dishes. Also I believe that this change would provide some level of discomfort to the public as the public transport system in most of the countries are not very convenient. In short, only increasing the rate of fuel would not protect the environment, people have to become conscious about the surrounding and put their contribution by many other ways such as aforementioned.

In conclusion, I agree that inflated rates of fuel would decrease the environmental problems but it is not the most efficient way, as it will benefit the environment but may provide inconvenience to public. Only increasing the rate of fuel would not improve the adverse condition of our environment, many other measures need to be taken such as planting trees, choosing glass over plastic and using renewable resources instead of fossil fuels.","**Task Achievement:**

"Some people think that museums should be enjoyable places to entertain people, while others believe that the purpose of museums is to educate.  Discuss both views and give you own opinion.","The role of museums in our lives has been widely debated. Opinions differ as to whether the role of museums is solely limited to entertain us or as a means of education. In this essay, I will not only discuss both sides, but also provide my viewpoint while concluding this.

To begin with, these galleries serve people in getting rid of their boredom. To elaborate, nowadays, people tend to get tired very easily, owing to their monotonous lifestyles. In order to mitigate this weariness, these archaeological places can serve as a one of the many options for them to explore and rejuvenate.

 Red Fort, for instance, is frequently visited by tourists and local people as a leisure activity.

Conversely, these museums are the symbol of our cultural history, identity, and traditions. Visiting these places helps people to broaden their horizon and enhance their knowledge about their ancestral roots. According to an article published in ""THE TIMES"", the students who explored these sites as their history assignment, achieved more success than other students in their exams. Besides this, feeling proud about their identity is an another possible reason. Because of the globalisation the world has become a smaller place, these places serves as a medium to connect people to their traditional roots,and also develop a social bond between them. As a result, they are proud of their national identities and its values.

To conclude, while there are valid arguments on both sides, I believe museums have an equally important role to serve as a leisure activity as well as for education, and people have sole right to decide upon what they want to do.","**Task Achievement:**

Some people believe that climate has the greatest affect on people's way of life. Others believe that the economy of a region has the greatest effect. This is both the views and give your opinion.,"Some argue that climate is the main factor determining people's way of life, while others think the economy of a region is the most important. I agree with both suggestions and I will explain afterwards with my opinion.

On the one hand, climate is a strong power that changes many parts of our lives. It decides what we can grow, what animals we can grow, and how much water we have. The climate also affects the kind of clothes and houses we need. For example, the public in hot, sunny places lives differently from those in cold areas. Where it rains a lot, society often relies on farming, whereas in dry places, they might depend on things like tourism for money.

On the other hand, the economy in a place really changes how people live. In areas with lots of money, pupils can get better schooling, healthcare, and jobs. A strong economy creates more progress better buildings, more jobs, and a higher standard of living. For instance, in cities with a strong economy, you'll find new buildings, lots of job options, and a good way of life.

In my opinion, both the climate and the economy have a big role in how people live. Climate can decide what you can grow or raise, but the economy gives us the money and chances to live well. In places with a strong economy, people can bring food from other places or use technology to handle climate challenges.

"Some people think that employers should not care about the way their employees dress, because what matters is the quality of their work.

To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?","There is an opinion that employers should not overly concern themselves with what their employees wear, as their quality of work should be the primary focus. I wholeheartedly agree with this viewpoint, and this essay will elaborate on my reasons.

The major consideration for employers should indeed be the quality of their employees' work. When employers prioritize work performance over dress code, they create an environment where employees can focus on their tasks without unnecessary distractions. For example, in the tech industry, companies like Apple have adopted a more relaxed dress code, allowing employees to wear casual attire. This approach has contributed to a culture of innovation, where employees feel comfortable and empowered to generate groundbreaking ideas. By emphasizing work quality over attire, companies like Apple have demonstrated that allowing employees to dress comfortably can lead to enhanced creativity and productivity.

Furthermore, an excessive focus on dress codes can negatively impact inclusivity and diversity within the workplace. When employers impose strict dress codes, they may inadvertently exclude employees from various cultural backgrounds who have unique clothing preferences or requirements. For example, in multinational corporations with employees from diverse cultures, mandating a Western dress code might alienate those who prefer traditional attire. Embracing a more flexible dress code policy fosters an inclusive environment where employees from different cultural backgrounds feel respected and valued, contributing to a more harmonious and diverse workplace.

In conclusion, employers should place their main focus on the quality of their employees' work rather than micromanaging their attire. As exemplified by companies like Apple and multinational corporations, this approach not only enhances work performance but also fosters an inclusive and diverse working environment.","**Task Achievement:**

Make some suggestions to solve the problem.","Unemployment among young people is an ongoing and increasing situation in many countries around the world. The fact that students cannot find jobs after graduation is the cause of certain complications and can be addressed/solved/tackled/resolved using several methods .

To begin with, there are a huge number of issues related to young jobless people on a personal as well as community level. Firstly, in terms of finance, young people cannot generate income unless they have a career. Becoming financially dependent, they can face a lot of difficulties in maintaining their daily life.

Moreover, workless people are one of the reasons that make social evils more serious. A person without a job usually spends most of the time doing nothing, which makes it easy for them to engage in wrongdoing such as robbery, theft, and drug addiction. 

To minimize and partially solve this problem,  education for the younger generations as well as government action are the most important. First of all, schools should equip students with practical skills and organize career orientation sessions for students. By doing this, it can be easier for them to find jobs after graduation. Also, motivating and encouraging students to participate in vocational training after leaving school for both studying and earning an income can help ease the problem. Furthermore, the government should promote the operation of local career and job placement centres. The activities of these centres should be propagated so that young people can easily access more job information.

Children find it difficult to concentrate on or pay attention to their studies in school. What are the reasons? How can we solve this problem?,"Education is the key to becoming successful in life, however, most of the students find it difficult to concentrate on studying at school. Although they feel distracted, there are a lot of courses that students need to cover, and I will discuss possible solutions for improving their concentration in the upcoming paragraphs. 

Firstly, the main reason that the students are unable to attention to study is that they feel fear because of the extra syllabus as they feel they are unable to finish on time. For instance, most learners prefer to complete topics which are easy as otherwise they feel a stress on mind to finish it. Secondly, children love to spend time on the internet where they play video games up to late at night which is the main distraction as they are unable to get proper sleep due to which they have lack of energy to focus on their studies. 

The prominent solution for improving the curiosity of students towards their studies is that they make proper time for sleep which helps for the proper functioning of the brain. Elders have to make strict rules regarding the playing time of the kids so they get enough time to complete the homework as well as get time to revise class work.  

To conclude, children want to play video games most of the time which is the main cause that they do not like studying, whereas, their parents should make strict rules to limit their play time so they can focus better on education.","**Task Achievement:**

many universities professional cannot find the jobs in their choosen profession.what factors may have cause this situation and what in your opinion should be done about it.,"It has been universally acknowledged that the problem of unemployment among university graduates is escalating at an alarming rate in the current scenario. This issue has been a depressing magnitude. Although a plethora of reasons are there yet some sensible solutions are also available to curb this grave issue.

To commence with  the first and foremost cause,  is a lack of professionalism because colleges  do not teach pupils about the value of being well-behaved at job interviews. Moreover, teachers in educational institutes focus on covering the topics in the syllabus and train students to achieve good grades . Undoubtedly,  a number of learners graduate from top universities  with excellent grades. However, they end up being unemployed due to a lack of knowledge about job opportunities, interview criteria and resumes. To illustrate, in developed nations, multinational companies recruit candidates based on their resumes, interviews and experience in the past and according to a survey majority of people are not called in for hiring events because of the unprofessional format used to make resumes. Hence, being a bookworm is not worth it as communication skills and a number of other personality traits can help to achieve  a reputable position.

Moving toward the ideas that can curb this issue, the best solution to this problem is to make it compulsory for educational institutes to introduce a course in the graduation program in which students will be taught about the proper format of making resumes. In addition, interview practices should be a part of the syllabus and the skills of making connections with people in their field should be taught. For instance, a survey was conducted and it showed that people who took extra courses to learn resume-making and to practice job interviews were able to gain jobs in their fields. Consequently, learners will gain confidence and will gain  an idea of real-world competition in finding jobs.

To recapitulate, without any doubt, this problem has become a burning question of the day. Therefore, educational authorities should come forward to mitigate this complex problem.","## Task Achievement:

"in some countries, more and more people are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the house or building they live in.

what are the reasons for this?

How can people research this?","The number of people who are interested in knowing the history of their accommodation has been increasing in some countries. What is the root cause of this curiosity and what can people do to solve this complicated question? It is clear we can trace the reason back to TV programs broadcasting many historical buildings in which people live, and we must do everything we can to handle the situation: namely by adopting an individual and group approach to comprehend the history.

First of all, we must recognize many TV programs all around the world broadcast  topics which are related to history. These can include the history of people's accommodation. By way of an example, some TV companies collaborate with university professors in order to figure out the background of buildings in both cities and suburbs. According to the article in the Asahi Shimbun newspaper published last month, eight out of ten Japanese adults answered they got interested in the history of their properties because of the above-mentioned programs. Therefore, more and more people are becoming interested in the history.

In order to research the history of people's properties, people should engage in an individual and group approach to figure out it. As an individual way, people could use academic or historical articles to find out the information related to their accommodation. Actually, this movement is already occurring in some countries in East Asia with great success. In terms of a group approach, people should request their government to reveal the history. If many people could submit letters of appeal to their government, the information will be provided. As a consequence of these measures, people will know the history of their accommodation.

In conclusion, many people have been paying attention to their properties and therefore some approach should be taken. We must solve this by obtaining necessary information from articles and requesting the government to reveal the historical information of the house or building where we live.","**Task Achievement:**

Some universities offer online courses as an alternative to classes delivered on campus. Do you think this is a positive or negative development?,"Under the development of sophisticated advanced technology, some higher education institutions can provide courses learned through the internet instead of traditional classrooms. In my point of view, this trend would create several benefits but there would be some drawbacks arising.
On the other hand, attending indirectly interactive courses is immeasurably beneficial to both professors and students. In other words, online courses bring so a wealth of convenience to learners since they enable students to save their quality time and finance as well. To be more specific, students can take part in any courses that they are interested in regardless of geographical distance or travel cost, which helps to reduce various burdens and enhance the gross enrollment rate significantly due to this flexibility. In contrast, a fixed curriculum in traditional classes makes students arrange their time and own schedule passively, which can limit their time management skills. In Vietnam, for instance, during the quarantine, online classes offered to students enable them to acquire knowledge sufficiently in safety without any time pressure or extravagant price of traveling.
On the other hand, there are also compelling reasons why this trend may bring some disadvantages. To start with, students may lose face to face interaction in unsociable learning hours, which can lead to non-comprehensive development in several immensely essential skills including interpersonal and communicative ones. Therefore, students are not able to be well-equipped in seeking jobs in the future which can affect career path negatively. Also, without competitiveness among peers, learners can easily lose the drive to try their best in order to have their desired academic results. An illustration of this is that, in some local high schools in my hometown, students usually have better performance at school compared to the online courses.
In conclusion, e-learning can bring so many pros to learners. Nevertheless, the downsides would emerge.","**Task Achievement:** 6.5

"Some people say that economic growth is the only way to end hunger and poverty, while others say that economic growth is damaging environment so it must be stopped. Disscuss both view and give your opinion?","Is developing economy harmful to the environment or saving our land from being destroyed constantly by human ignorance and greed?  The answer is positive.

In recent years, extreme environmentalists acclaimed that their activities, including protesting and advocating for conservation and improvement are the best way to avoid our planet being damaged inevitably. Other people argued that the growing economy would resolve the problems of scarcity and starvation, which are the real causes of environmental destructing somehow nowadays.

Firstly, starvation and scarcity of resource are important issues in our world, but resolving these problems are not standing on the opposite side of environmental protection. They are not topics in the same category. The efforts striving to improve the prosperity of society aren't meant it's damaging our nature,  but for which, is now being protected by lots of advanced technics attributed to economic growth. For example, in Ning Xia, a province of northwest China, local peasants have benefited from the increasing economy and technologies and can have better measures to protect grasslands. 

On the other hand, ending hunger and poverty, along with protecting the environment, which one is the prior issue? For some perspective of environmentalists, the best earth is a world without any human species. There would be no hunger and poverty issues if human beings never existed before. That is ridiculous. The environment is not a stationary object that never changed since the birth of our mother planet. It doesn't need to worry about our world excessively, because it has experienced so many extinctions and rebirths after numerous catastrophes and keeping vibrant now.

The public can easily  listen on their mobile phone or any electronic equipment only if they have internet.

Secondly, when these free resources have been used, they do not check whether it is right to be utilized or not. Those artists cannot prevent it to be played or control where to play.

Secondly, on the contrary, it also does have its bright sides. Since you download it online, there’s no charge on it. You do not need to pay extra. Moreover, these free documents can be used in educating.  We can still admire it personally. However, if you showed in a municipal place, you might upset the original founder.

"Some people think that art is an essential subject for children at school while others think it is a waste of time.

Discuss both sides and five your opinion.","Today, teaching  art in schools is the subject of dispute between people who regard  art as really necessary for children and individuals who find art a waste of time. In my view, art does not play an important role in a child's development.

         Many people consider that art should be taught in schools since children need it to change and make fresh their brain. Because art can be a factor for them to learn how to concentrate their mind on one thing. During art lessons children are required to focus on one particular thing, so art can help to learn to pay attention to also their other necessary works. As a result, they can be productive in their other subjects. Therefore art is vital for everyone, especially child's development. 

     On the other hand , there are also people who believe art subject is not required from  children in school. It can take the child's most   time which must be spent on their more crucial subject as realm-related ones. As a result of this, they do not have adequate knowledge of their vital subjects since they spend their precious time on art. 

    In conclusion, nowadays, while many people argue that art is not a key factor to a child's education and should not be taught in  schools , others believe art has a big influence on a child's school life, and later also. I am of the opinion that art should be taught in schools as the second statement is that art should be taught in schools as it can help  children's improvement.","### Task Achievement:

Some people believe that eventually all jobs will be done by artificially intelligent robots. What is your opinion?,"In the future, artificially intelligent robots will do all jobs, replacing humans in the workforce. While it is possible that robots will eventually do all exactly repetitive jobs, it is unlikely that jobs that require empathy skills by humans will be taken over. This essay will discuss why people, not replaced by robots, will carry out only some specific jobs.

Robots may do jobs with repetitive and straightforward steps that do not require specific and complex human skills. Many companies have applied artificial intelligence robots into programmable tasks to improve processes instead of hiring and training their employees. In many manufacturing factories, for example, many routine production steps have been replaced by automated solutions run by robots that cost far less than employees. In addition, the automated stations work around the clock and require no holiday or sick leave like the workforce. For these reasons, some suitable jobs that can be suitable by robotic process automation will be replaced.

On the contrary, some human jobs cannot be replaced by robots because artificial robots will never reach the efficient capacity to do them. The jobs that need psychology, education, medical, and social work require human empathy. In undeveloped countries, for instance, uneducated people need social workers to help them relieve their minds. Additionally, when people face fatal health problems, such as cancer, doctors gradually attempt to empathise, parallel with a situation assessment, to their relatives or even directly to patients. Therefore, it is too complicated that robots will be programmed to well complete those jobs instead of humans being.

In conclusion, it is increasingly possible that robots will be gradually replaced most human tasks soon. Robots may entirely complete the unskilled jobs; however, not all jobs are replaced by automated solutions, sophisticated jobs that still need empathy from humans will always exist. Ultimately, the complicated jobs that are required a high-skilled workforce are still safe parallel in the automated solution environment increasing.","## Task Achievement:

Some people think that robots are important for human’s future development. Others think that robots have negative effects on society. Discuss both views and give your opinion,"In recent times, the development in the field of robotics has increased rapidly and its prevalence can be noticed in many places. Many believe robots are crucial for human development whereas some argue they have a negative effect on society. This essay would discuss both  views with empirical evidence and conclude with my opinion.

To begin with, artificial intelligence is one of the greatest milestones achieved by humans. They can be used to study places which are inaccessible to humans. For instance, the world-renowned rover Curiosity, was sent to Mars for a detailed analysis of the planet's features. Without robotic technology, it would take another decade to achieve this feat. Hence, this technology plays a vital role in the development of mankind.

On the other hand, robotic machines have replaced men in many jobs. For instance, in many food and packaging industries, programmed machines are used as they are more efficient and fast when compared to a worker. Furthermore, a robot can work for long hours without any breaks, thus increasing in productivity of a company. This scenario can lead to an increase in the unemployment rate causing a detrimental effect on  society.

To sum it up, robots have a pivotal role in  future development and the need for them is inevitable. Although this development has a downside, considering the future technological advancement, robotic science and technology are essential to achieve it.","**Task Achievement:**

Some people argue that governments should make laws regarding people's nutrition and food choices to improve public health while others contend that this is the freedom of personal choice and responsibility. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.,"Now a days people are demanding strict legal provisions on essential nutrition and food behavior to improve people’s health.  However, the others advocate that taking vitamins and food is completely individual choice. In this essay, I will discuss on both perspectives and will put my own viewpoint at the end of the essay.

On the one hand, some group of people strongly believes that the government should be responsible for formulating laws on public health. This is because people are paying taxes to the government from their regular income. For example, the government collects its revenue from the taxes of its citizens so the government has to act on voicing for people’s health. Thus, some set of individuals emphasize on the responsibility of health ministry on advancing legal laws on public health.

On the other hand, some second on the sole responsibility of government in developing laws for health of its native. They state that the wellbeing is completely a personal choice and dependent on individual’s right to be fit and healthy. For instance, some trusts that the different food habits and supplements work differently on each individual’s body. Furthermore, same provisions on health laws may not create the same benefit to all individual because each individual has different body type and have need different preferences on food. 

In conclusion, some agrees that government should be made accountable for legalizing health laws whereas some disagrees and believes that health is an individual preference. In my view, though health is a personal choice but it should be legalized and constantly monitored from the government also to create equal health benefits for all people.","## Task Achievement:

"Many university graduates cannot find a job in their chosen profession. 
What factors may have caused this situation and what, in your opinion, 
should be done about it?","Nowadays we are facing the issue that a great total of graduates are completing their studies and becoming skilled but there are not many opportunities for them to get themselves involved in relevant jobs. This can be addressed by some important factors such as difficult environments and the poor infrastructure of industries. These can be solved by introducing some solutions like making the system more decorated and so on.

To begin with, one of the most deleterious factors is nepotism. We can see in most cases that recruitment has been taken by the control of the people who always try to select those candidates who are known to them, although it is required to choose  skilled  applicants. For instance, the managing director of a company has the power to impact the employee selection process so if he wants to keep that person who is very familiar to him then there should remain nothing to do with him. Another factor regarding this issue is that there could be less total of vacancies in the job market. Sometimes the balance between the total of grads and the required employee gets missing. For example, especially in under-developing countries, the control of the number of alumni versus post vacancies is very fickle. The university produces a greater number of graduates than the industries need. That causes highly skilled alumni to become unemployed.

So, the authorities have to take  responsibility to counter these issues. One solution could be for the appointing system must have to be non-partial and authentic so that only eligible ones could have the chance to get shortlisted. Suppose in the interview, the interviewer should check the actual ability of the candidate, not his family status. On top of that, the industries are needed to expand, which will cause a great number of job fields. The company may collaborate with the research departments of the universities which will help a lot in introducing new products or methods in their working fields. 

In conclusion, there are some pressing factors in the unemployment of  highly qualified graduates for example, partiality in the job opportunity or imperfect management of developing working areas. The government can obtain some solutions like making a fair interviewing panel or spreading out the job field in such a way that the grads get the capability to prove themselves.","### Task Achievement:

What are the reasons for this?

How can people research this? 

Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","There is an increasing number of people who are interested in excavating the history of the house or building where they live. I think people do that because they have the cognitive to protect the historical value of the buildings and the sense of connection that people felt within the exploration. In order to research their history, people can gather the knowledge and memories that elder citizens around them have and go to the libraries in their cities.

Many buildings with great historical value had been destroyed because of the wars and people's ignorance in the past. Therefore, many people appeal for the protection of buildings. After people have the cognitive to appreciate the  beauty of historical buildings, people willing to find out the history of the buildings in their own living places. What's more, the process of exploring the stories about the buildings in their cities enhances the connection between them. Because the forms of architecture are special due to the unique elements a location has, such as weather and culture, these link everyone who lives there and make them feel united.

In order to know the history of the building where they live, one of my suggestions is to ask the elders who also live there. Because they have more experiences since the more time they have lived, they might have experienced the changes of the time of these architectures. Another suggestion is going to local libraries and searching for the information which had been recorded on paper.

In conclusion, people's increasing interest in excavating the history of  architecture in the place they live is due to their cognitive of protection after the destruction of many buildings and the sense of connection that is given to explorers.

Many people have jobs that involve working shifts (i.e. working at night). What are some of the problems that shift workers might face? What can be done to solve them?,"There is no denying that working shifts might be harder than other regular jobs. This essay is intended to analyze the several drawbacks this category has to face daily, as well as to suggest some solutions to reduce the burden on workers. 

Firstly, there are numerous issues when considering working shifts. In fact, if it is not always pleasant to work, it is much less enjoyable when it is due during nights, bank holidays or weekends. While ordinary employees have the chance to spend festive moments with friends and relatives, healthcare workers, to give an example, are going to the hospital. Year after year, these missed precious moments contribute to a potential burn-out. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that working at night alters the circadian rhythm, which has negative consequences on the physical and psychological sphere. To conclude, these are just a few of the innumerable concerns shift workers have to deal with.

On the other hand, there are different solutions to at least sweeten shift-workers'workers conditions. For instance, an economic incentive should be given to them, especially when considering weekends and bank holidays. In addition, the number of wards should be limited following the guidelines written by the Society of occupational medicine. Finally, extra days off should be guaranteed, in order for workers to spend a proper amount of time with families and friends while they are not sleeping, as well as to profit from daylight to accomplish ordinary tasks. Perhaps, with those suggestions they might cherish their employment a bit more. 

To conclude, there are countless cons to working during shifts. However, there are luckily a bunch of options, alternatives and ideas to ameliorate the condition of this essential class of workers.","## Task Achievement:

"Schools should focus on academic success and passing examinations. Skills such as cookery, dressmaking and woodwork should not be taught at school as it is better to learn these from family and friends. To that extent do you agree or disagree.","It's argued that schools should pay more attention to students' academic success in exams instead of teaching cooking, sewing and crafting skills as they can be acquired from relatives and friends. This essay strongly disagrees with the opinion because these skills support a well-rounded education for all students and can contribute to a stable income in the future.

It's undeniable that culinary, sewing or wood-making classes make up a well-rounded education for students besides the traditional academic subjects. In the learning process of these skills, pupils can apply knowledge from other classes and take on numerous soft skills. For example, learning about culinary can help combine a myriad of information from biology into understanding how different food combinations affect our bodies, practice making meal plans and prepare healthy dishes on their own.

Another reason for my disagreement is that we're experiencing the rising number of unemployed people due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the global financial crisis. Therefore, students who are able to excel in numerous skills can help a student have more diverse career paths and ensure a continuous source of income without depending on a sole job. For instance, after being laid off in their 30s, a couple in China recently became an Internet sensation for utilizing their cooking skills to successfully change their positions from software developers to street food merchants. 

In conclusion, this essay strongly disagrees with the belief that schools should only focus on students' academic success instead of teaching them life skills such as cooking or crafting. The reason is that these subjects add up to a well-rounded education for the students and can ensure them a more stable income in the future.","**Task Achievement:** 7

However, the solution of more plantations may not become possible due to excessive soil erosion and lack of land.

On the other hand, people believe that circumstances can be made under control if effective measures are taken right away.To begin with,if the community has already realised the value of planting trees , then the government should make provisions related to logging.Moreover , advanced technology can prove effective in protecting endangered animals.For example, China has been utilising genetic technology, especially to protect panda's life.Additionally , the crowd ought to be encouraged to plant more and more trees.Therefore , the adoption of these solutions can be helpful in tackling global concerns directly from the root level.

Some employers believe that job applicants’ social skills are more important than their academic qualifications. Do you agree or disagree with this opinion?,"Some recruiters suppose that for candidates, soft skills are more crucial than academic background. I totally agree with this notion as social abilities are the bottom line when getting jobs.

Firstly, being equipped with interpersonal skills such as communicating and interacting with co-workers helps job applicants to discuss with others and figure out solutions in any type of working environment. Hence, even a newbie who does not much specialized knowledge can contribute to solving and accomplishing assignments. Although academic capabilities play vital roles in the working process, they might become less effective in teamwork tasks requiring novel ideas from different perspectives if individuals are not able to connect with other colleagues in the workplace.

Secondly, the ability to multitask is also important in people’s careers, especially in these days and ages when everything happens fast and simultaneously. If a worker is merely good at technical knowledge, he might be confused due to a lack of capability to complete different tasks constantly. Consequently, he will become overwhelmed by heavy workloads with tight deadlines then. For instance, in the advertising field, being able to handle many tasks is always prioritized as the employees have to monitor campaigns, make new plans and meet clients’ requests at the same time and their performance outcomes will be evaluated based on all the aforementioned scopes as opposed to solely professional knowledge.

In conclusion, despite the undeniable importance of candidates’ educational backgrounds, I believe that being good at soft skills such as communication or multitasking is crucial in people’s careers since it can help them to improve not only individual results but also collective outcomes.","**Task Achievement:** 6.5

However, Others ponder that museums ought to offer education & knowledge.  This essay will articulate both views as far as I am concerned, I  am in the favour of Former notion. 

To commence with the initial view that why art galleries should be a place of entertainment the people act as a stress buster. In other words, In this fast-paced era, the Majority of the masses do work or study which not only lead to franchised scheduler but also deprives them to provide relief to their minds.

In some countries more and more people are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the house or building they live in. What are the reasons for this? How can people research this?,"The number of residents who are interested in exploring the past of dwellings they live in is increasing in some regions. In this essay, I will describe the reasons and the way residents find history.

 There are some reasons why the occupants tend to explore the past of their living places. Firstly, people consider that the history of their house is important because the location has been culturally impacted by circumstances and neighbours. To be more specific, residents need to assimilate into that culture once they move to the place. Therefore, they check whether the culture is the one they like. Another reason is that residents prefer to stay in a dwelling that has great stories. For instance, if renowned persons such as presidents' families, leaders for revolution, skilled professors used the residence, dwellers can enjoy by imagining how the notables contributed to nations and became famous.

 Several methods to search histories are available. Nowadays, the internet has a greater impact on searching histories than paper books. As anyone can write articles on the internet without restrictions, it is possible to search both the bright and negative sides of history and reputation about dwellings. Additionally, there is a strong possibility that beneficial stories have been handed down by the local people.

"In some countries, celebrities complain about way the media publicize their private lives. Some people say that they should accept it as part of their fame. 

Do you agree or disagree?","In some countries, famous individuals often feel unhappy about how  publishing interferes with their private lifestyle. Some argue that it is just part of being famous. However, I believe that celebrities, like anyone else, should be treated with respect and have the freedom to control what they share with the public. In this essay, I will share my thoughts on this topic and reach a final conclusion.

To begin with, some people believe that celebrities should accept media intrusion because they willingly choose to be in the spotlight. They share parts of their lives on social publishing, give interviews, and attend public events, which makes people interested in them. This sometimes blurs the line between their public and private life, leading the news to focus on personal matters. From this perspective, it is essential for personage to understand that fame has its ups and downs, and they should be prepared to handle both aspects.

Be that as it may, we should consider the human side of fame. superstars are just like regular people and deserve privacy and respect for their personal lives. The constant media attention can cause stress and emotional problems, and it can even harm their relationships and families. Being famous does not mean they should give up their right to privacy. Therefore,  publishing should focus more on their talents and achievements rather than invading their private matters without permission.

In conclusion, after discussing this topic in-depth, I agree that superstars have the right to complain about the news's intrusion into their private lives. While fame may be necessary for them to gain popularity, it should not give the media unrestricted access to their personal affairs. Finding a balance between public interest and respecting personal boundaries is crucial for maintaining a better relationship between public figures and the news.","**Task Achievement:**

Leaders and directors in organizations are normally older people. Some people think having a younger leader would be better. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"It is argued by some that giving power to young people to lead organizations can be more beneficial than letting older people be in charge of leadership. I totally agree with this view because of the following reasons.

I hold a firm belief that younger people can bring many benefits to the development of an organization when they become leaders or managers. First of all, compared with senior people who often suffer from health problems, young people have a competitive edge in terms of youth and physical strength. This means that they are willing to sacrifice time, effort and devotion to work longer hours or build a reputation for their business, which old leaders may find  beyond their ability to do. Besides, with  sensitivity and quick adaptation to changes in the market, young leaders seem to be brave enough to take risks and materialize innovative initiatives. With these differences, young people can lead their organization to a higher level of status and competitiveness in the market.

Some people argue that it would be better for an organization when its leaders or managers are older people. The reason for this argument is because those people are very experienced, which means that they can have a wide vision as well as abilities to predict unexpected setbacks. Thanks to accumulated experience, elderly leaders can orientate their businesses to overcome tough times and gain sustainable development. However, I am more convinced that young people are able to do better than these old directors in a constantly-changing world these days. In fact, the more experienced people are, the more conservative they become. In other words, the conservative nature of elderly seniors can be considered as a hurdle for their adaptation to continuous turbulence in the business practice, hindering the breakthroughs of an organization.

In conclusion, due to the aforementioned reasons in terms of youth and risk-taking nature, young people deserve to be held accountable for leading an organization or a business rather than older ones.","**Task Achievement:**

Some people think that robots are important for humankind's future development. Others think that robots have negative effects on society. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"In this age of technocracy, among many wonderous inventions, robots have proven to be the most promising of them all. Many deem it to be a worthy addition to our lives, but contrarians to this notion believe that, it can prove detrimental to our society. In this essay, I will ruminate on both sides, before making my statement.

Those  who consider robotics to be vital for the advancement of civilization, do so by observing several quality-of-life changes brought by it. Such as, the integration of rudimentary assembly line machines used for product manufacturing. Moreover, there exist self-driving cars, waiting to revolutionize methods of transportation. Additionally, there have been major strides in the development of life-like androids. All in all, the future seems bright indeed according to these supporters.

However, trepidatious ones vouching against this technological progress, do so by witnessing drawbacks brought by these gizmos. Like, mass lay-offs caused by the introduction of automatic tools in many factories around the world. Furthermore, these people do not look favourably at the idea of automation in vehicles, as they are wary of hazards associated with it. Also, they hold fast to the belief that, there will come a day when automatons will completely render human talent superficial. As an example, the advent of artificial intelligence art (AI art) has filled artists around the globe with dread, as they think that they will soon be replaced by their man-made counterparts.

Some people say that playing computer games is bad for children in every aspects. Others say that playing computer games can have positive effects on the way children develop. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"While some people believe that playing computer games is detrimental for children, others claim that it has some benefits in terms of their development. In my opinion, playing computer games should be considered  positive for children’s development as individuals.

On the one hand, it is obvious that spending a lot of time in front of the screen and playing computer games can bring lots of problems for children’s health, especially their vision. When kids play video games being slumped in front of the screen for hours, it definitely makes their eyes dry and, therefore, destroys the protection layer. Furthermore, in some cases, young people will face other severe issues connected with losing their vision clearness, so at the end of the day, they will have to wear glasses in order to correct their vision and see the objects around them clearly. Another key problem that could be brought about by playing computer games is addiction. Children do not have highly developed brains to protect themselves from the mental issues that they could face by being in virtual reality non-stop. As a result, many parents ought to monitor their children in order to prevent them from being addicted and committing suicide, for example.  

On the other hand, when children spend their time by forming strategies in order to complete the next level of the game, they surely become more responsible for the result and gain important skills such as strategic thinking and tactic vision which might be helpful for them in their study in the university and the future life, and I agree. By being involved in the process of building a strategy and being responsible for the results, children will be aware of the future consequences of their failure. Moreover, playing video games encourages some young people to be interested in coding and software development and, probably, choose it as their future major in university.

"Some people believe that holidays are necessary for students, others think that children should not have holidays because it is just a waste of time. Do you agree or disagree?","Nowadays, it  is a moot issue whether children should have holidays or not. It is  believed by a lot of individuals that it shouldn't be, others think that it's just a waste of time,however.From my perspective, it is necessary that children have some free time from their work so, they could relax or learn something new that they haven't yet.

Learning something new that is not related to  academics is the thing that is quite beneficial for them. Since If they would have some time from their main studies that they are having, then they learn something different activities and learn some skills: public speaking cooking time management and so on, which would be beneficial in that they later live especially for take any job and to interact with others.

Have time for recreational activities is another merit of having vacations. It is generally seen that by learning their academics  for a whole year continuously, they get rid of it. So they want some time for them. For instance, many pieces of research proved that if children devote some of their time to activities that help them to be relaxed then it would be better for them as they could perform much better in the exams. 

To conclude, as vacation has a lot of advantages such as they come up with an opportunity to have knowledge about different things that they want to do and relaxation, that are the major ones and because of them, I think that Vacations  should be promoted instead of restriction.","**Task Achievement:**

"Experts believe that over the next decade, robots will be doing many of the jobs currently done by humans. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this.","Nobody is a stranger to the fact that we live in a digital world. Many experts contend that over the next 10 years, robots will take over the jobs in many industries, which are currently done by people. To my way of thinking, there are both pros and cons to this proposal in equal measure. 

There are many advantages, if you ask me, to this situation. In the first place, it increases work productivity at the workplace. Machines can work much longer hours than human employees without taking breaks. Their result is much more efficient and far more accurate than employees. People may make mistakes at work, but machines do not. Added to this, they do not have to be paid. Some occasional repairs are may be required over the long periods.  This saves a great amount of money for businesses. For instance, many supermarkets in many countries use automatic customer check-out points, which avoid hiring many workers. 

Be that as it may, the downsides of this phenomenon, if you ask me, are just as big. For one thing, it raises the unemployment rate. People who lose jobs because of this will have no income and therefore no money to spend. This could cause serious consequences for the economy. To name but one example, governments cannot get taxes from individuals. As a result of this, governments do not have enough funds for schools, hospitals, public transport and many other facilities and infrastructure. It follows to stand, therefore, that the quality of all essential services will suffer. 

Turning to my own experience, the way things are when it comes to this issue in my country, China, is the same as it was across the world over. My home city of Shanghai is a classic case in point. Here, many factories use robots to make products. Many workers cannot find jobs due to the higher preferences for machines in industrial sectors. 

At the end of the day, there are merits and drawbacks to all choices we make in life. It is very important that governments play a role in creating enough employment opportunities for humans. This will develop their societies in a much more sustainable way.","## Task Achievement:

"In some countries, more and more people are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the house or building they live in. 

What are the reasons for this? 

How can people research this? 

Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","In recent years there has been an increasing number of residents curious about their dwelling records. The leading cause of this phenomenon is the feeling of belonging to the place where they live, and In my opinion, the best way for them to learn more about it is through the Internet. In this essay, I shall delve into the list above and provide some evidence to support my statements.

I believe that the significant reason that dwellers discover their home history is based on the connection to their living surroundings. This situation can be especially relevant for those who have lived in their neighbourhood for decades and even inherited it from their family members. Historical research can help homeowners learn more about the person who loved deeply and lived there. To illustrate it, a study in France taken by residents who had researched the past events of their abode exposed that over 88% had done it based on the attachment to their living spaces.

There are considerable ways for individuals to investigate and understand more about their home, but the internet is the best and most efficient method to start the exploration. Search engines such as Bing and Google provide numerous resources and websites for citizens to learn. Searching online can reduce the time spent on finding information, as most of the data has already been collected, and it is possible to manage multifarious resources, including building permits and the old house photograph. For instance, using digital tools such as Yahoo can decrease time by at least 50% for organising and researching data. 

To sum up, I reckon that nowadays, those are curious about the building they live in due to a sense of belonging and wish to understand their place better.

Furthermore, in my perspective, the online is the best tool for them to analyse historical events.","## Task Achievement:

"Money should be spent on creating new public buildings such as museums or town halls rather than renovating the existing ones.
To what extent do you agree or disagree?","It is believed that money ought to be disbursed on forming new public settings, for instance, museums and town halls as distinct from the renovation process of the current buildings. In my opinion, the public finance should be allocated to both the renovation and the creation of cultural areas as they are valuable assets of a city independently of the mode of existence. 

Governments should pay attention to conserve historical museums, regional areas or other buildings, as they are vital for a country to attract tourists. Some of them are successfully doing it through restorative methods. Conversely, others who do not have any remnants of historical places are obliged to create new ones. Take for instance, the United Arab Emirates are constructing hundreds of buildings every year to develop its nation culturally, and thus it is one of the most visited country in its region. 

European countries have many renovated museums and halls, and this gives a feeling as you were in a time tunnel. However, newly constructed buildings are also successful at transmitting the ancient texture of that city to visitors. In terms of costs, the renovation can be by far more expensive than the construction of a new one, yet rich countries will overcome this problem easily. 

In conclusion, public settings play an important role in the cultural development of the nation, and thus they are highly preferred tourist attractions. I believe that, money should be spent on both of them. Rich countries may allot more funds for the restoration, while poor ones have to focus on building these with spending the least amount as possible.","**Task Achievement:**

"In some countries, more and more people are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the house or buiding they live in.


what are the reasons for this? 
how can people research this ?","Nowadays, people become highly interested in the history of their houses or the building they live in. This will discuss the reason for this trend and how people search for that information.

To begin, people want to search about their property's history because they are trying to add more value to it. Finding interesting information will give their home more emotional value on top of its original value. For instance, houses that belong to a famous singer or actor are sold for a higher price than other normal houses. Because people think the emotional value of those houses will remain constant and may even increase in the future. As a result, if they ever decide to sell the house, the buyer will pay a higher price because of its history.

They can research this historical information either by asking their neighbours or by searching the internet. Many find those two ways the fastest ways to find answers to their questions about the history of their houses. They can ask their neighbour about the history and if there is anyone who knows the true value of the area around him, or they can take some pictures and post them on the internet and wait for some experts to answer their questions. For example, before we bought our house two years ago, I asked the neighbour, who lived by the house, if there was something special about it, and they showed me a history book that contained all the historical events and people who had lived there.

In conclusion, knowing the history of your house will add more emotional value to it, and two of the best ways to search for its history are by visiting the neighbours and asking them or by searching on the internet.","## Task Achievement:

People nowadays tend to have children at older age. Do the advantages outweigh of the disadvantages?,"These days, most married couples have a tendency to give birth to  offspring at an older phase of life. This trend can avail little more time for the parents to make necessary arrangements for the newborn. Also, it might result in incapability to reproduce. This essay will discuss both the gains and losses of giving birth at a later age.

Firstly, becoming parents at the elder stage has the privilege of having extra span to provide abundance to their coming child. In the current situation where there is a constant rise in the costs and education, it is very hard to think about having a kid. From 25 to 30 period of soul, the public struggles for their career and settlement with a good amount of earnings. For instance, a student who just passed out with his doctorate degree at the year of 29 and gets married at the youth of 31 has very little time to settle in his career and go for family planning. Thus, few parents are inclined towards having a juvenile after 35 life span of maturity and can give a better environment to the born minor.

Conversely, this could also cause health issues to reproduce after 32 years of lifetime. Growth after the thirties requires  taking care of the body as it becomes weak as compared to the below thirty years period. In this case, it could lead to weak reproduction strength in a person. To prove this, there are a lot of IVF and test tube baby centres available for such married couples. Therefore, it is advised by the senior citizens in  society to have a youngster soon after the wedding to avoid such fitness problems later.

In conclusion, babymaking at above 32 years of duration has both merits and demerits. However, giving birth to the baby at youth surely surpasses the possibility of abnormal well-being in reproduction.","**Task Achievement: 6**

"In the past, people stored knowledge in books. Nowadays people stored knowledge on the Internet. Do you think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?","Technology has shaped the world in such a way, that nobody can even think to spend a moment of their life without it. Thus, the biggest change we can see in the reading habits. People used to read more books to gain knowledge but these days such material is available on their fingertips with the help of internet. In my view, both statements have their own pros and cons.

To begin with, before the internet era one has to carry the weight of books to get the knowledge but with the internet, everything is readily available on their handheld devices. No one has to go anywhere to get the books to study instead, one just need to type in a few keywords and pretty much everything is cooked up for them. To illustrate, when I was in school I had to buy purchase books or borrow from the library but these days children get the same amount of education even with various methods with help of technology. Thus, the internet clearly has changed the conventional way of learning.

In addition to this, the internet has  huge storage to keep data the whole world, whereas  writing in books may fade away. It is an intelligent way to preserve our heritage or other important data for the upcoming generation. To exemplify, Google known as the biggest tech giant in the world  has zillions of records kept on the cloud

, which are just a few clicks away from us. Therefore, worldwide web storage is a boon for mankind and outplay the use of books.

In a nutshell, the internet is clearly outweighing the advantages of the knowledge stored in books. Although many people may get troubled by misleading information on the internet  it still stands out for its capacity and accessibility.","**Task Achievement:**

"Some people believe that eventually all jobs will be

done by artificially intelligent robots.

What is your opinion?","Artificial intelligence and its impact on employment is increasingly becoming a hot topic of debate. While a number of people believe that artificially intelligent robots will replace humans to do all jobs in the long term, there are many who have opposing views. This essay will argue that eventually, most jobs will indeed be done by robots powered by artificial intelligence although not all jobs as believed by some.

Around the world, giant strides have been made with regards to the capacity of artificial intelligent robots to carry out complex tasks typically done by humans in industries like manufacturing, shipping and information technology. These robots are consistently demonstrating higher efficiency levels with cheaper overhead costs than their human counterparts, causing many industry leaders to cut down on their human workforce in favour of adopting robotic systems. For example, Tesla, the global leader in electric vehicle manufacturing, recently announced plans to lay off 20% of its workforce as well as plans to build two new factories across North America that will be fully operated using robots powered by artificial intelligence. Many more of such announcements are expected in the coming decades, corroborating the belief that human beings will be made redundant as more artificially intelligent robots replace them at their jobs. 

However, not all occupations can be efficiently done by these robots. Professions such as prostitution, policing, marketing and customer service require human factors such as empathy and emotions to be delivered efficiently. For instance, studies show that many customers prefer to interact with a human customer service agent over the phone to help resolve their problems, rather than interact with a non-human system. To sum it up, artificial intelligence may never be able to replicate the human factors listed and as such cannot perform tasks that require these factors. 

This essay has argued that artificial intelligence robots will eventually be able to do most jobs and also touched on the fact that not all jobs can be done by these robots. In my opinion, a lot of jobs will be done by robots in the long-term but not all jobs.","## Task Achievement: 7

"Some people say that public sports facilities improve people health problems. Others argue that this development has insignificant effects on public health.
Discuss both views and give your opinion","It has always been a debatable concern that the physical wellness of a community. Few ethnic groups assume that introducing public sports facilities tends to provide the solutions for physical problems while the other groups advocate that it is unlikely to have any relevant medical impacts. This essay delves into both views before deriving a stance.

On the one hand, in the present paradigm shift, people seem to be more health-conscious than in the past days. As a result, these health clubs and game centres have become the order of the day. Primarily, the consumption of unhealthy packaged food and, the strenuous work culture have been made the individuals vulnerable to various lifestyle diseases. Consequently, to enhance the depleted energy society like to opt for these advancements for the betterment.  More importantly, many folks, do not have the space or access to equipment, utilize these opportunities to tackle the body related  menaces.

On the other hand, those who argue against these advancements hold valid points to be considered. As such, the ill-health and  stress could not be alleviated with these infrastructures, unless citizens follow a healthy way of life. Has there been a safe distance from soft drinks and fast foods, there would have been a sustainable health model. Furthermore, rather than spending too much money on these facilities, it could be used for improved medical assistance and social awareness of health. Ultimately, not the centre provides to aid for the sound fitness but the individual himself neesed to bother it.

"Some people think that all teenagers should be required to do unpaid work in their free time to help the local community. They believe this would benefit both the individual teenager and society as a whole.
Do you agree or disagree?","Nowadays, there are many people who believe that all teenagers have to take apart in the summer camp for their spare time which can be helpful for their society. They also feel that in general, these materials have played a crucial role on their personality. Despite of this idea, I personally disagree with this notion, hence reasons will be analysed in this article.

In my opinion, it could be a misconception about students and teenagers which are obliged to do an an unpaid job in the summer. First of all, they should have the opportunity to do whatever they want in life. However, if they forced, it may affect on the outcome of their job, because they have done something which they are not eager to do it. Secondly, when students and teenagers attend to school, they have a hectic curriculum which means they do not have adequate time to refresh their mind and peruse on their interest hobbies. Finally, with these situations, if we force them, we will kill their free time.

My idea varies widely with this notion which these obligations would be beneficial both for teenagers and their community. Firstly, by following their ideas, students are forced to do things that are against their will. So as a result, they cannot do their best in their work and after a while they will figure out that they have just wasted their time by doing these unpaid jobs. Therefore, it would not have an impact on their personality. In addition, if they are forced, we will increase the number of people who are depressed or have a lot of problems in their lives. For instance, some researches on some students in the UK indicate that those students which had gone to the summer camp, had a number of issues related to their society after that work.

In conclusion, while teenagers may choose to work for free in their spare time, I believe that we should not make this compulsory.","**Task Achievement: 7**

"Nowadays, more and more people decide to have children later in their life. What are the reasons? Do advantages of this outweigh disadvantages?","In the present age, the major section of  society has a mindset to conceive a baby after entering  the thirties. People believe that they should first focus on their career and after being successful, they will plan regarding family life. In the following paragraphs, I will discuss  the possible reasons for this thinking and further, I will give valid points as to why having children later in life could possibly lead to disadvantages.

To begin with, the root cause for this mindset is that nowadays, society has money minds and they want to earn a handsome amount of money in the initial stage of their career. For the purpose of earning money, young couples avoid conceiving, because they think that with kids, they will not be able to target  their careers. Furthermore, the young generation like to do social interactive activities by having parties  and going on vacation with friends and they like to enjoy their life like a free bird. But, our generation believes that after having a child, life will not be the same. So, that's why couples avoid having kids at the early stage of marriage. For instance, after a child, you cannot go to late-night parties and you cannot leave him alone at home. So, after having offspring, your whole day revolves around them and you cannot spare time for yourself and it is a valid reason by people do not want to conceive early.

Though  people want to have kids later, there are certain drawbacks to choosing this path. Firstly, after a certain age, the count of sperm decreases and similarly females also start facing hormonal issues due to which sometimes it becomes impossible to give birth to a baby naturally. The second drawback is that when  individual plans to have offspring at a later stage, in this case, the age gap between parents and children increases. Due to this, there is a generation gap among both  generations which leads to clashes between children and parents. 

So, in the end, I would like to conclude that though a career also matters in the individual's life  at the same time, he should also focus on family growth and try to maintain a balance between both roles.","## Task Achievement:

"Some employers believe that job applicants’ social skills are more important than their academic qualifications.
Do you agree or disagree with this opinion?","In today's ,world social skills are given utmost importance over the educational background and many of the recruiters try to employ candidates with such qualities.  I partially agree with the statement and I would like to elaborate on it in detail below.

The merits of outstanding social skills are apparent.  Firstly, communication is the key factor that helps to interact with different people on the whole and assists in creating a good buyer-seller relationship.  It can promote the growth of the business too.  Secondly, by having good communication skills anyone can excel in their respective fields either it may be sales or any other departments for the matter of fact.  For example, an employee with excellent presentation expertise can help customers understand the products and can convey them to buy that product.  Furthermore, employees with better interaction skills are generally easygoing, which is crucial for the workplace and the employer too.

In contrast, some people believe that academics are the pre-requisites of  employment.  Apparently, there are many positions that require high knowledge and capability of dealing with them smoothly.  For example, an administrative role in a company requires the applicant to have high qualifications to take prompt managerial decisions.  Such qualities are developed when a person has studied the subjects thoroughly.  Not only having social skills but also acquiring higher studies is equally important to run any organization smoothly.

In conclusion, I think both advanced studies and other communicational skills are of equal importance in today’s world.  Having workers with both these qualities make an organization grow and prosper thereby helping in building a strong workforce altogether.","### Task Achievement:

"Some people think the main benefit of international cooperation is in the protection of the environment, while others think that the main benefits are in the world business. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","With the rapid development of globalization in the past decades, many countries get profits due to the increasingly strong bonding through the intensive interaction with others. The environmental protection and economy have equally benefited from such international cooperation under the background in major regions.

On the one hand, it is commonly known that environmental problems have a heavy toll on the well-being of the whole society. Thus,applying global cooperation can unite more countries and clear the responsibilities of each in preventing detrimental pollution. A great case in point is that the developed countries can support many high-tech devices and professional experts in the developing regions to tackle the environmental problems that can not be solved by limited local technology and lacking of biologists and chemists and so on.What is more, a great number of extinction species can also be rescued by the international organisations when they face detrimentally killing result of the lagging traditions in specific areas.

On the other hand, the international connection allows entrepreneurs to extend their businesses out of the country, which could make rational use of different resources to help the economic development on both sides.For example, many western companies set up factories in Asia since there are more low-price labour forces and some factories were set in the original source of goods in order to reduce the transportation cost. What is more,one more beneficial fact caused by international cooperation is that the foreign businesses also create many job opportunities for local citizens in some developing countries where the industrial development is primitive and inferior.

"The best way to solve the world’s environmental problems is to increase the
cost of fuel for cars and other vehicles.To what extent do you agree or disagree?","n recent years, some people believe that the government increasing the cost of fuel for vehicles is the primary way to solve the environmental problems, whilst others hold the reverse viewpoint. I disagree with this statement. In this essay, I will explain my viewpoints in detail in the ensuing paragraphs.

To begin with, the front and centre in this favour are that cars are necessary means of tools for commuters due to inconvenient public transport in a rural area.Moreover, it is undeniable that the exhaust gas emitted by the usage of automobiles causes environmental pollution. However, raising money for fuel does not solve the root of the phenomenon. For instance, people need to pay more for fuel in order to get to a specific location, which does not change the probability of use. This indicate that this policy would not improve much environmental issues.

At the other end of the spectrum, transportation indeed plays a vital role in our daily life. Considering  carbon dioxide emission, it is the leading cause of air pollution. Therefore, the government may divert some budget to build more facilities for public transport. On the other hand, if they provide some discounted ride plans for taking ones, it would be a better way to decrease the chance of the use of private vehicles. The monthly pass is a salient example. Based on such compelling evidence, it appears that government incentives may improve air pollution. 

In summary, the growing use of automobiles is an issue that needs to be addressed. It is widely believed that the promotion of public transportation can solve environmental problems nowadays.","### Task Achievement:

"Some people think that robots are very important for human’s future development. Others, however, think that robots are a dangerous invention that could have negative effect on society. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","The phenomenon of the effects of robots technologies development has aroused wide concern among various circles. Divergent as people's views on the issue in question may be, I believe that it is more beneficial for humans in the future.

On one hand, some people think robots will take their job away because the expenditure on robots is noticeably less than human salary. For instance, the basic cost between machines and human has dramatically different. Machines only need fuel and time-to-time maintenance, but a human requires much more, ranging from housing, food, and clothes to transportation. It reflects a company's spending on machines and humans respectively. As a result, some people strongly reject the development of robots.

On the other hand, I believe that automatons can bring us a more wide range of benefits. One of the advantages is that they can work in dangerous environments such as clearing the wall of tall buildings and deforestation. This will in turn prevent the accident occur. Another reason is better shipping efficiency with lower prices, it is beneficial to most businesses these days. For example, automatons shipping can run 24 hours a day which means the period of delivery will be decreased, and the price should be able to cut off half of the original shipping cost because it does not need to pay salary to a machine. Therefore, many people feel that robot development can bring us a better future.

Under this line of thinking, although there is a good reason in favour of the argument that robots are dangerous inventions for our future, I believe automatons development would replace us to finish the most basic work and allow people to live their own life.","### Task Achievement

"In many places women are taking jobs, which are traditionally done by men. What do you think make these changes happen? What’s your opinion about it?","Nowadays, more and more women are working in plants, firms and industrial sites where only men  are used to be employed. Women are now more ambiguous and competing with men. This essay will explore reasons  why women are taking places occupied by men and at the end of the essay will underline my opinion.

Firstly, the reason is that there are so many single women pursuing their careers instead of building families. This could create competitive women who are eager for career development instead of building healthy relationships.For instance, compared to married women single one will wish for high-paid jobs and career opportunities because the only passion of not married women is their job opportunities.Thus that is why men are being replaced by females in job places.

Secondly, there are so many lonely mothers who give upbringing to their offspring. Consequently, they need more prospective job positions with high salaries since not everything is affordable nowadays because of high-cost products.For example , in order to afford a good education and food supply for their kids' parents should earn more money. Thus, women are taking any positions even men needed positions because it gives them the opportunity for earning high wages.

To conclude, it is true that women are taking men's traditional workplaces. In our contemporary community , the world it is common that women and men are on the same level.

Some people think that increasing business and cultural contacts worldwide have positive influences on development; others think that they have negative effects on national identities.

Some people think the government should increase the cost of fuel for cars and other vehicles in order to solve environment problems. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Many people argue that environmental issues are needed to be solved strictly by the government's policy of increasing the cost of private vehicles. Personally, it is a useful measure, but other measures might be more effective.

There are some underlying reasons why authorities should make an effort to raise petrol prices. Firstly,  it would limit the number of car journeys and the money raised could be used to improve public transport. Because of the sharp rise in appearance and convenience of cars, humans forget the harmfulness of using their vehicles related to the environment. Therefore, the government should upgrade and expand public transport provided by the cost of private vehicle users. Moreover, more goods would travel by rail. It is clear that freight services and the useful solution former would reduce vehicle emissions and the greenhouse effect.

Apart from the practical measures mentioned above, I believe that other solutions are more effective. There are more and more traffic jams happening on the road daily, especially during rush hours. In this situation, congestion charges should be the best idea to improve transport infrastructure.For instance, London's government used this method to avoid traffic congestion influenced directly by transport facilities. Additionally, free bus and train passes are other measures that helped to reduce the use of cars and improve air quality. Local authorities should subsidize the cost of fares to encourage people in using public transport.

"Some people believe  that eventually all jobs will be done by artificially intelligent  robots?

What is your opinion?","It's argued that  with today's advanced automation, robots will replace humans in all jobs in the coming days. I strongly disagree that there are many jobs that cannot be substituted by automation despite  the advancement in  technology. This essay will elaborate on few real-time cases.

  Firstly, not all task can be replaced. For instance, Labour delivery in hospitals must and should be done by doctors, because of complications at times, that need to implement on the spot which only comes with experience. However, robots with programme implanted might not be the better option. Secondly, not only this, we have few more cases where mechanisation fail if replaced. Let's take the pilot, Also like the above case, we need to act on real-time circumstances such as weather, turbulence etc., where human pilots have no replacement. Therefore, I strongly oppose the opinion that all jobs will be replaced by artificial intelligence.

  There are few jobs that can be replaced by robots in place of humans. For example, in an Insecurity stream such as bomb dismantles we can save lives if we can use automated gadgets such as drones and robots.

"Many people argue that in order to improve educational quality, high school students should be encouraged to question and offer criticisms on their teachers. Others think this will lead to a loss of respect and discipline in the classroom.

Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","Educational institutes are not only important for the theoretical knowledge that is taught in them but also for the overall development of cognitive and social skills of the students. Some believe that high schoolers should be allowed to cross-question and offer criticisms on their educators while others oppose this notion, as it might lead to poor discipline in schools. In this essay, I will discuss the merits of both  sides of the argument and state my opinion about it.

It is argued, that students should be encouraged to question and criticise what they are being taught as it will help them develop the skill of critical thinking . This will be beneficial to them as they will be able to use this skill to analyze various problems in life and also form their individual opinions.  Critical thinking may also save them from misinformation , for example, when they come across some information or propaganda on the internet. Moreover, the habit of questioning will build curiosity in various subjects and may possibly lead to innovation. 

On the other hand, encouraging such behaviour may lead to these pupils becoming overconfident , resulting in loss of discipline as they might start disrespecting their teachers. They may criticize every statement and instruction given to them, which will lead to the teachers losing control of their classrooms. Additionally, students may lose their humbleness and become ruder.

"Nowadays families move to different countries for work. Some people think it has a negative effect on children, while others disagree. Discuss both views and give your own opinion?","People have different views when it comes to moving to other countries for a better job opportunity. While some argue that this trend might be harmful to children, others have an opposing idea. Nevertheless, my opinion lies with the latter.

On the one hand, travelling abroad to find a job can harm children in several ways. Firstly, it  may affect children's languages. These children would not be able to speak their mother tongue fluently after staying in a foreign country for a couple of years. The impact would be more prominent when children try simultaneously to learn their first language. Secondly, children would copy the natives' lifestyles, norms and habits, which might not be acceptable based on their original religion. For example, gender equality and homosexuality are considered a sin from Muslim parents' point of view.

On the other hand, moving abroad can bring certain advantages to children. To elaborate, they may have this unique opportunity to learn about new cultures, customs and traditions while  broadening their horizons. Nowadays, knowledge is power and people who know more will have a brighter future, thus, these children would be more successful if they decide to return back to their home due to access to outstanding experiences. Moreover, these children can make plenty of friends while living in a foreign nation. In the upcoming years, when these children will apply for a job, their indigenous friends can be helpful by giving them valuable advice.

In summary, the pattern of moving to another country for work can have positive and negative consequences to children, but I think that its merits outweigh the drawbacks.","### Task Achievement:

Some believe that eventually all jobs will be done by artificially intelligent robots. What is your opinion?,"In all countries around the globe armed police personnel are common. However, the necessity of arming them is debatable. Some people claim that it leads to the unprecedented attack on common people and perhaps to state terrorism and violence, while I concur with the side of those who argue that it is essential to maintain law and order. The reasons are manifold for my support  will be discussed in this essay. 

On the one hand, I totally disagree with the notion that state terrorism is raising because of armed police officers. In fact, many people who believe this notion are not ready to understand the fact that the police department is directly controlled by the home department of government. And thus there are myriad public councils are working to strictly monitor the judicial use of these weapons by police officers. Additionally, these people often come with an example of some random police encounters with common people. Although these incidents are true, I believe these are mostly accidental and the police officers who are responsible for these also have been punished severely for their negligence. 

On the other hand, the country's entire internal security management is under the control of the police department. In order to maintain these superiorly, they are in the need to develop some sort of fear among people. This fear in my opinion is healthy for the betterment of society. Furthermore, police and state security forces are the first-line workers who need to witness some dangerous situations. Despite their personal well-being, they work towards the welfare and security of the people. For example, recently one of the police inspectors in my neighbourhood was brutally attacked by some petty thieves during a situation when he tried to arrest them for shoplifting. This incident made me  think in favour of armed police officers that if he was allowed to carry his weapon, he would have got prevented  the attack. 

In conclusion, not only do armed police officers use their weapons to maintain law and order, but also for their self-protection. Therefore, I totally agree that arming  police officers will never lead to state terrorism or violence, in fact, it prevents these.","**Task Achievement: 5.5**

However, the response is not fully comprehensive as it primarily focuses on the argument that arming police is essential for maintaining law and order.

"Some people think that secondary school children should study international news as one of the school subjects. Other people think that it is a waste of valuable school time. 
Discuss both views.","When considering what to be taught in secondary school, people are still divided about whether international news should be one of the official subjects or not. While there are benefits to adding this new channel into the classroom, there are also good reasons why it might be helpful to only focus on current curricula. 
The statement that international news should be studied at secondary school is strong for several reasons. In terms of social view, it would help students to gain a wider perspective of the world. In this way, youngsters can be widely acknowledged with current affairs so that they could be aware of how to behave properly. Moreover, in the education view, international news accompanied by different academic subjects such as science, literature, mathematics would complete the integrated learning, which provides students with a full development to lead their life in the future. It is, therefore, clear that global updating plays a vital role in assisting education
On the other hand, it is also understandable that including international news as a subject in secondary school curricula is definitely irrelevant. First, students are now snowed with a hectic schedule, which may result in overloading if any additions. Moreover, in the current education system, especially examination, it places a great emphasis on academic subjects, if students don’t concentrate enough on these qualifications, they might fail. Secondly, the violence represented in many of today's news could affect students' performance. This is because, at the secondary school’ age, students are still inexperienced to understand those negative aspects. So the youngsters tend to misjudge the situations and act inappropriately. Therefore, the study of international news would be a destructive and wasteful use of school resource.

Some people believe that eventually all jobs will be done by artificially intelligent robots. What is your opinion?,"With the advancement of artificial intelligence, there are many people who advocate that humanoid robots can replace completely humans. Indeed, it might a trend in the contemporary day; however, I believe that some jobs are still requested for real people.  This essay will discuss compelling examples to sustain my belief. 

There is no doubt that Ai can do numerous works. Because of deep learning and AI algorithms, computer and robots can apply repetitive and simple work, such as manufacturing and accounting. Take factories for example. Through precision computer science, AI might improve effectiveness, accuracy, and productivity compared with what traditional laborers did in the manufactory. Also, AI workers will work for their employers without asking for rest. It is significant to accelerate the productivity and the quality of production. 

On the other hand, AI might not take over some intricate jobs which are required for human judgment and experience.  For example, some medical procedures should be operated by skilled surgeons. It is because complex surgeries are crucial and are related to legal issues. Thus, human surgeons should take responsibility for medical decisions instead of AI robots.  Although there are increasing numbers of driverless cars on roads, the autopilot system is reported with an unexpected gap in the reality and causes several fatal car accidents worldwide. Thus, AI-driven vehicles cannot fully substitute for drivers in the short-term time.

"In some countries more and more people are becoming interested in finding out bout the history of the house or building they live in. 
What are the reasons for this? How can people research this?","In many countries, society tends to do research about the history of a shack or a building where they dwell. In this essay I will outline the reasons for this and how can folk research instructions about houses.

There are many reasons why crowds try to find the historical meaning of their apartment. Firstly, there is an understanding of what their ancient relatives did. For instance, a lot of communities found out that they had some nobleman in their bloodline. In addition to it, an apartment or a building with a historical value may be a valuable investment. After some period of time, the price of this building can increase. For example, some traditional houses with unique architecture in China are very expensive as they have extremely interesting and valuable historical backgrounds. Thirdly, some criminal action might be done there as well. For instance, there can be a stock of drugs or even a dead body might be found by accident. If the police make an investigation about it, the householder will probably face  an enormous number of problems.

Regarding the methods of research, there are several different ways how the public can find  info about the historical meaning of the building. For instance, in many countries, before purchasing a residence, a population may have an access to  material concerning the previous owners of this place. Also, people can find news and interesting facts about the place on the internet. Nowadays, almost everyone has an access to the internet, so it will not be a complicated process to search it out.

"Nations should spend more money on skills and vocational training for practical work, rather than on university education.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Many today feel that countries should prioritise vocational training over higher education due to changes in the labour market. In my opinion, though there are strong economic reasons to support this idea, university education holds greater value.

Those in favour of more practical skills training point out the financial benefits. Most university graduates are burdened with student debt and face uncertain job prospects. In contrast, training schools are cheap, fast, and ease students into steady employment immediately. The jobs they train for are also most likely recession-proof and durable, including positions as cooks, hotel managers, and skilled technicians. Someone who is firmly established in such a job in their early 20s does not have to deal with the pressure associated with university life and its incumbent debts. Instead, they can begin to set aside money for a house or start a family.

Nonetheless, lacking a university degree limit one's options. The jobs available will pay well initially and be secure, but offer narrow scope for advancement and virtually no opportunity to switch the career paths. An individual with a university degree, on the other hand, might begin from a lower position, but has a higher ceiling on future earnings. It is also possible for them to explore a variety of fields. Most good jobs require at least a bachelor’s degree even for simple internship vacancies. Lacking such a degree, means restricting oneself to manual labour or service industry jobs. The actual learning that takes place at university, particularly for those with multi skills majors or studying at liberal art schools, also encourages students to consider a wide range of possible career options.

In conclusion, increasing funding for vocational training is an attractive yet short sighted approach that curbs possibilities. Governments ought to continue to support higher education even in dark economic times in order to reap future rewards.","## Task Achievement:

Many students find it difficult to focus or pay attention at school nowadays. What are the reasons for this? What can be done to solve this problem?,"Concentrating on lessons is one of the most common problems for a lot of pupils at schools. There are some reasons  why is this happening and also the solutions for them which will be discussed in this essay. 

  The first reason for the absence of concentration are subjects that are taught in a monotonous way. In such case, kids get distracted by other things they bring to school from home. For instance, in our era of technology, even elementary school students have a phone or tablet where there are numerous apps and games. As a result, a child pulls the phone out of his pocket as soon as the lesson gets boring. The solution is for the teacher to engage students in different interactives to better grasp the topics. This method will decrease children’s interest in participating in discussion and hols their attention. 

  Another reason is a teacher’s approach to everyone. Situations, when no attention is paid to some students, occur frequently and as a result, a kid starts doing anything but not listening to the pedagogue. However, if some kids can tell their parents about that type of accident, there are some who does not. Moreover, somebody can even believe it is normal behaviour for a teacher. For instance, some teachers can offend students because they do not meet the standards they imagine in their heads. To tackle this issue, the entire teaching staff ought to attend psychologist sessions before starting to work with children. 

  In conclusion, both problems can be solved if the efforts are made, especially when a person likes the job and is ready to do anything to involve pupils in the process of education.","**Task Achievement:**

"The best way to teach children to cooperate is through team sports at school, to what extent do you agree or disagree?","People have different views about the best way to cultivate children's collaborative spirit. Although doing team sports is one of the efficient ways to achieve that, I believe teachers can find better solutions than this method.

On the one hand, team sports demand students to work closely and communicate frequently, which will improve children's cooperative skills. During this process, they will realize that everyone is born with strengths and shortcomings and only by working together can they have a competitive edge in the future. Also, doing team sports brings students more happiness than individual sports and help them to make new friends, which may motivate them to cooperate with others in the future.

On the other hand, other methods, such as working in groups to solve a practical problem, are also efficient to boost students' collaborative spirit. For example, there are a wide variety of interdisciplinary programs in many schools, which need the contribution of team members that are good at different subjects. Without joint effort, children will never be able to come to a satisfying solution. As a result, they will realize how important it is to cooperate with and learn from each other. Meanwhile, students working in these joint projects will also find it helpful to work together because it can enhance their problem-solving skills and boost their knowledge in all the subjects that are used. 

In conclusion, although taking team sports works well in teaching children the importance of cooperation, I think there are better ways that teachers can come up with to encourage their students to work with joint force.","**Task Achievement:**

To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"There is a hot issue about whether all towns and cities should have large public outdoor places like squares and parks. I disagree with that opinion, in my perspective, I assume that not all towns and cities need it.

A large public outdoor place contributes to citizens have fun there and offers them opportunities to involve diversity activities like amusement competitions. Having a spacious public outdoor area not only cost a huge amount of taxpayers money but also need to use a huge public space source which ought to have better usage than squares or parks. For example, in some developing cities,they can not afford the expend of building large public amusement park which is a waste of government’s fund that could be poured in education or the local economy so that could change local society instead of a park. 

On the other hand, the public area can not be fully used due to the less population, even if there is a large public in some tiny cities.It turns out that is a waste of money as well. However, things will completely different in metropolitans, because a large number of populations have more need for amusement. So, there is no need for small towns and tiny cities to have a large public area, especially for those developing cities and those that have less population.

Moreover, advertisements are vitally important in the country. I will be explained both views below the paragraphs.

To begin with, all of the companies were shown their positives characterizes of the product, such as good for health, fresh drink, healthy food, etc. For example, a lot of products were advertised by channels (Animal planet, man vs wild, starspots, etc.) in the programs or movies breaks that will cover the children’s and youngers’ aspiration while they do not know the negatives effects.

Consumers are faced with increasing numbers of advertisements from competing companies. To what extent do you think consumers are influenced by advertisements? What measures can be taken to protect them?,"It is crucial to consider the impact that many advertisements from different business competitors have on their customers. This essay will explore some of the issues which have resulted from this effect and propose some measures that might address them.

Firstly, one concern about using advertising is that people are tricked into buying things that are not necessary for them. This is because they are enticed to catch up with the latest trends, especially from celebrities they have been following. As a result, people squander their hard-earned money, which should have been poured into their long-term financial investments, on extravagant commodities. To tackle this issue, governments should educate their people about the essence of living below their means. In doing so, people will ensure not only do they have a wealthy and perennial future, but they also contribute to reducing waste.

Secondly, another significant issue associated with advertisements is the risk of misled harmful products. The reason for this is that, nowadays, there are a lot of companies which merely chase their benefits recklessly. These businesses try to get their customers to buy their products as much as possible without considering the future repercussions that may occur, which is a real danger in the context of medical supplies. For instance, people could perish due to misusing drugs, but televisions and newspapers today are saturated with abundant strength-boosting pills. This problem could be mitigated by tightening the advertisement regulations to ensure many noxious ads are filtered before they reach end customers. 

In conclusion, advertisements from competing businesses have created two problems which are extravagance and detrimental products. However, these issues could be minimized if governments invest effort in improving citizens’ knowledge and stiffening advertising regulations.","**Task Achievement (8)**

"Some people think that children should be taught at school to recycle materials and avoid waste. Other people believe that children should be taught this at home.

Discuss both opinions and give your own opinion.","In recent times, it is paramount to recycle plastic bags, bottles etc. To reduce the wastage of natural and man-made resources and to improve its usefulness. Many people argue that children should learn this skill of recycling objects at school, while others insist that parents should teach this to their children.  I admit that parents can act as a guide or mentor, but I firmly believe that in academy students can get practical knowledge also. This essay will discuss both the views by demonstrating facts and points.

To begin with, it is very important to protect the environment from getting polluted. For this, schools can introduce a compulsory subject of waste management in the curriculum. Therefore, children will learn more about it as dedicated time slot will be allocated for exploring this issue. Moreover, children will get hands-on experience and practical knowledge too. It is evident that cognition and intellectual skills are developed more by performing group activities. Peers play a vital role in encouraging and inculcating interest in things which aloof individual finds hard to incur. So, school can act as a channel to motivate its students in reducing the misuse.

On the other hand, kids at home imitate what their parents do. For example, the way parents eat, communicate, etc. Similarly, parents should imbibe the habits of reducing and reusing left over items in themselves, which will be ultimately inherited to the next generation. It has been always stated that home is the first school of the kids. Therefore, parents should indulge their kids in such activities and help then in becoming responsible citizens of the nation. 

 To conclude, parents are the primary source of the knowledge of the kids and what parents can do nobody can do.

Thus, they can contribute in a better way in waste management and make this world a better place to live.","**Task Achievement:**

Some people believe that teenagers should be required to do unpaid community work in their free time. This can benefit teenagers and the community as well. To what extent to do agree or disagree?,"Our teenagers nowadays seem to be unresponsible towards their society as they have been occupied by social media feeds. Hence, this is a suggestion to engage them in voluntary jobs to aid their community and improve their skills at the same time. In my perspective, this step could be beneficial for both the nation and adolescent as it will improve his responsibility and his interpersonal skills which could be a life-changer for our offspring.

  As a starting point, when a teenage boy provides services for the elderly for instance, he will appreciate his life in addition to this rewarding satisfaction of helping others. Consequently, this experience will improve his character and will make him willing to help the underprivileged people in his society. Furthermore, this trend will make the children more introverted and interact with their peers to reach  ingenious solutions to the problems which their countries suffer from.

  On the other hand, this voluntary work will teach a valuable lesson to our generation about their duty in their surroundings and will strengthen the bond with the nation. Certainly, when the child will feel that he makes a difference in his community, he will improve this sense of nationality simultaneously. As a consequence, the new generations will be capable of dealing with the emerging obstacles in their countries.

Human activities have a negative effect on plant and animal species. Some people say that it is too late to do anything. Some people think that we should take effective action to improve the situation. Discuss both sides and give your opinion?,"in many recent years, the globe is going to be unhabitable for many life forms due to undesirable activities done by humans. As a result, protecting the environment and keeping plants and animals safe has become one of the most controversial issues among scientists and environmental activists. In this regard, some people claim that the current situation can not be improved, while others take the opposite side and believe that some practical decisions should be made. 

On the one hand, some people are of the opinion that the current trend that has been occurring in the world in recent decades is uncontrolled and can not be stopped easily. They believe population explosion and as a result, exploitation of nature and its resources such as water and plants in order to produce foodstuff and necessary products is unavoidable. This is because, in their statements, humans should take priority over all the other creatures. Therefore, it could be noted that, instead of investing huge amounts of either financial or human resources to save some rare species, which can be considered a waste of money because of their insufficiency, we ought to allocate this budget and workforce to enhance the health care and education system in poor countries. For instance, the latest statistics illustrate that the average budget of typical conservation programmes is equal to constructing 50000 schools in Africa where the majority of kids suffer from a lack of education.

On the other hand, many experts state that the current circumstances send a clear message that the globe is going to be unhabitable in the near future for all beings including mankind. This means that planning and implementing conservation programmes and strict rules in order to save special plants and animals not only help them to escape from the circle of extinction but also could shape our children's future in a far more efficient way. As a result, providing that the governments assist to keep the environment in balance by imposing harsh rules to deter factories and individuals from destroying nature, the position will be improved significantly. For example, in Germany, the government introduced harsh penalties for logging and poaching in 2006, which resulted in a substantial drop in the number of animals death figures after 10 years.

To sum up, although changing the available situation is a tough challenge and requires huge investment and international assessments, I firmly believe that this is possible to tackle this problem only if authorities take practical steps.","## Task Achievement:

There can be many reasons to find out the past of a place but one of the most important would be to find out about the water level however there could be plenty of water available there have been times when redevelopment of unconstructive buildings requires a brief study including the soil concentration, rain salinity levels, air quality.

"In some countries, more and more people are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the house or building they live in.

What are the reasons for this?

How can people research this?","Nowadays, society in certain nations is growing interest in exploring the past story of the places they inhabit. Personally, I believe that the inhabitants who are concerned about the comfort of living in their places will be intrigued to learn their living places' history. Moreover, this process can be done by uncovering interesting stories and hidden details of the area. 

First of all, one of the most common reasons to find out the backstory of a place is backed by the urge to connect with their living spaces in order to live comfortably. For instance, there is a specific neighbourhood in South Tangerang in which the houses' walls are often soaked by water every rainy season. After the house owners established a further investigation, it was revealed that the whole cluster was built above an area that used to be a swamp. In this case, people found answers to their setbacks by learning about the historical aspects of their habitats.

In addition, the research process of discovering the history of the buildings can be achieved by finding out about captivating trivia and unseen parts of the place. Using the same setting as the previous example, people in that area who struggled with leaked walls when the rain poured unveiled the truth by noticing that the GPS pointed to a watery area when they input their addresses. This group then asked experts in geography about the origin of their land and confirmed the facts to local governments. 

To sum up, the rationale for the people who become interested in exploring the history of their home is the curiosity to learn about the past in order to answer today's problems within the houses. Additionally, people can research this by looking at the small and rather implicit details of the neighbourhood.","**Task Achievement:**

Some people believe that teenagers should be required to do unpaid community work in their free time. This can benefit teenagers and the community as well. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"It is not unusually to see young people are mandatory for doing housework. Some have argued that the youngers doing work in the association for free in their free time can have advantages both for the community and teenagers. Personally, I completely agree. In this essay, I will explain why this initiative will benefit teenagers and the neighbourhood.

The main reason why the younger should do unpaid community work is that teenagers can have a healthy lifestyle. There is no doubt that young students spending much free time gaming or studying means less time for exercise, and a much more sedentary lifestyle, which can result in chronic diseases such as obesity, heart disease and diabetes. Students will have more opportunities to exercise instead of watching TV or playing video games, for instance, if those works are mandatory for them. The healthier life youngers have, the more chances to do what they want.

In addition, in terms of association, this behaviour will save a lot of money. The neighbourhood does not need to hire more staff because there are lots of youngers doing work for free. For example,  Teenagers can do some easy work such as cleaning and helping old people, which will cost a lot of budgets. Every dollar that can be saved on hiring staff can be invested in infrastructure, which can increase the well-being of habitats. Clearly, this initiative will be a benefit to the association in the long run.

In conclusion, I do believe that compulsory works have many advantages, not only for the younger physically healthy  but also for the development of the community.","**Task Achievement: 8**

"Some people say that the best way to improve public health is by increasing number of facilities,others, however say that this would have little effect on public health and other measures are required. Discuss both views.","It is true that improving public well-being is one of the most significant issues nowadays. Actually, sport is a crucial way that leads  to a healthy lifestyle. There is a genuine concern that the best solution for boosting public fitness is  to found numerous play buildings. The advocates of this view play facilities should be increased. However, there are many people who would argue that it is not an effective way, that's why the government should find out other remedies instead. 

 To begin with, those in favour of multiplying the facilities have reasonable reasons for increasing fitness organizations. It might be a unique effective key for urging citizens to enhance their strength. Indeed, training with sport in the hall gives individuals an opportunity to be powered both physically and mentally because of having an attractive friendly atmosphere. Moreover, halls or buildings are convenient for those who prefer indoor activities rather than outdoor plays to train with  the sport. 

 Nevertheless,  it costs  an immense amount of money to construct the building and its maintenance as well.  Additionally, people may ignore attending such kind of training  due to having instant social and academic life. For instance, a human who is really busy all day long continually delays participating in business activities to strengthen his energy. Virtually, it will be more efficient if the government devises financial incentives, interesting encouragement or subsidies to push people to be more attentive to their well-being. In fact, a person can walk 10000 kilometres per day leaving his car at home motivated by giving 10 dollars.

THE ONLY WAY TO IMPROVE ROAD SAFETY IS TO GIVE MUCH STRICTER PUNISHMENTS ON DRIVING OFFENCES. TO WHAT EXTENT DO YOU AGREE OR DİSAGREE?,"In the last few years, the debate regarding road safety has been raised. Some people claim that the only way to increase  road security is to have strict rules and punishment systems. However, I believe that such measures will not be enough and we need more actions to tackle this problem. 

Firstly, the government should have the responsibility for ensuring that the country has a safe route according to the standards. For example, in the major cities, we should have huge roads then small network routes. In addition, roadway maintenance should occur frequently in order to avoid accidents. Furthermore, we should have a national roads safety committee that will inspect and standardize the traffic safety issues. For instance, the committee will give guidelines to be followed as well as training to the inspectors to monitor the progress. 

Secondly, the government also needs to make clear traffic rules and distribute them to the people. In other words,  theoretical knowledge should be included in driving lessons. In addition, such knowledge should be distributed to all roads users. Thirdly, the presence of traffic lights is essential to allow smooth movements of the vehicles. All of that together with a strict punishment system will decrease  accidents and promote roads safety. 

In conclusion, to decrease the accidents and make sure the security of motor traffic, cyclists and pedestrians we should have excellent roads as well as a formal committee that responsible for the guidelines. In addition to a strict fines system. Also,  a theoretical exam should take place for all driving students.","### Task Achievement:

"Money offered for post graduate research is limited; as a consequence, some people argue that financial support from the government should only be provided for scientific research rather than research for less useful subjects. Do you agree or disagree?","Financial support is one of the important needs for graduates and postgraduates in other to fulfil their research. However, some people claim that the government should only financially promote scientific investigation rather than other subjects. In my ,opinion I totally  agree with the statement because science contributes to the evolution of the world . 

To begin, the knowledge industry requires a lot of attention and financial support because they are the most important corporations in the world .Furthermore, they contribute to the survival of species and the well-being of humans as well as animals . For instance , in the year ,2020 the whole world faced the COVID-19 pandemic which had an impact on the nation. Each country, especially  Europe had to financially hold up the scientists to supply a vaccine. This actually helps them to provide us in this year 2021 with a different type of  vaccine that is helping the community to fight against the virus.

In addition, investing in postgraduate scientists is supporting the medical and technology research department for a better and easier future way of life . This is the best way for the government to improve the knowledge industries to fight against future problems and also upgrade our lives. For example, our way of communicating has been boosted for the past 10 years with the hold-up of science. We can be connected at all times, working from a long distance and also being in touch with one family at every moment of the day . Thus , it is much easier to communicate and facilitate our conversation.

"Some people believe that they should be able to keep all the money they earn, and should not have to pay tax to the state. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","It is argued by many people that all earnings should be used for their personal use rather than paying taxes to the state. I disagree with this statement as these taxes bring many advantages to society and the country.

On the one hand, a huge number of individuals believe that their earned amount must be used for their own benefits, such as living expenses, utility bills, school fees, cars, and others. Also, they believe to invest in long-term or short-term plans for saving purposes as a result, they use that amount to improve their living standards. However, the masses avoid paying income tax regularly. For instance, according to a recent survey conducted by the government of Pakistan, which reveals that around 60% of the population did not pay the income tax in 2019.

On the other hand, the government takes taxes for many reasons. First and foremost, medical insurance, which is free of cost for any citizen of the country in Pakistan. Also, there is a massive discount available on medicines from the insurance company. Secondly, the government spends millions of rupees to improve the infrastructure of the country, such as road construction, railways, airports, shopping malls, and others. Last but not the least, the government pays off debts from these amounts.

To sum up, the government takes these tax amounts to improve its economy and fosters numerous benefits to the local community. It is a national duty of every resident to pay a small portion of their income to the government for their own advantage.","**Task Achievement:** 7.5

Moreover, individuals would like to have a longer life. In other words, at present, the average lifetime of humans is seventy years old. Therefore, If medicines and medical treatments are more enhanced, humans will have a longer life.

On the other hand, the obvious reason that some people believe that there are more crucial problems is that presently, there are a lot of environmental threats that affect our lives. For example, air pollution is a significant problem that has severe effects on humans because the fumes emitted from cars can cause  lung disease. On top of that, engineering issue also plays an important role in our lives. That is to say, engineering development such as autonomous cars can make individuals more safe and comfortable.

To summarize, although there are tremendous reasons why folk think that research should focus only on health issues, I personally disagree with this notion and believe that there are more crucial problems.","## Task Achievement: [6]

"In some countries, people encourage students to find part-time jobs while some people don't. Discuss both sides and give your opinion.","It is often suggested that students should indulge in part-time internships while undergoing their studies. Some people, however, may argue and discourage students from doing so. I will discuss both  views in this essay but personally, I believe that youngsters must find part-time jobs which will help them in long term.

To begin with, those who do not favour students in applying for half-time placement states their reason that freshmen should concentrate on their studies and complete their degree with distinction. They think that getting involved in work at this stage will create unnecessary extra pressure that will lead to low grades in college or university. Moreover, they think that this time can be utilized more on exam preparations required for higher studies. For example, undergraduates in their final year usually do not opt for any internships and exploit their time in preparing for MBA and master’s exams. Hence, for these reasons, some individuals do not encourage pupils to work.

On the other hand, part-time jobs offer lots of advantages to younglings. Firstly, they can apply their theoretical knowledge and gain immense experience through these temporary placements. And secondly, the work experience gained can help them land  their dream jobs as most recruiters prefer people having some experience. For example, many engineering colleges in India have made it compulsory for their students to undergo two months of internship which benefits them in achieving their dream career. Therefore, it is advised to undertake a part-time profession for the above-mentioned motives.

In conclusion, I agree that students must take on part-time jobs to ensure that they gain relevant experience which will give them an enormous advantage in developing their careers.","## Task Achievement:

"Some people think the money spent on developing technology for space exploration is not justified. However, there are more beneficial ways to spend this money. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","the issue of whether the money should be used justified has been raising a lot of debates. Some might say that there are so many ways to invest money such as help poor people, construct infrastructure or develop computers or so on. On the contrary, others insist on the opinion that in the development of technology, people should open their knowledge by exploring the earth to promote human life. Viewing from a general perspective, I personally agree with the former opinion for the following reasons.

To begin with, the funds of the countries should be invested in by taking care of the inhabitants and environment because this is the main factor which builds a nation. Firstly, citizens are the element of the foundation of the countries so if their life is great, the nation will be the development. For example, using funds to help the homeless have a house and settle down, if people’s lives are stable then the country will be stable. Secondly, building or repairing infrastructure makes the state look beautiful and clear because the outlook is traits to appreciate the development of the nation-states. For instance, fixing the old building can substantially help the countries become more developed and prosperous. Finally, make use of wealth on  growing the public, bringing the country's economy and socializing expansion.

On the other hand, some of the population think that exploring space can help  society predict everything before this happens so that a human can prepare to confront or find the way to fix it such as climate change or earthquake. However, if the crowd spend a lot of cash on space exploration and do not care about society and habitat

"Some people think the main purpose of school is to turn children into good citizens and workers, rather than to benefit them as individuals.


To what extent do you agree or disagree?","there are several arguments about the institute. many nations argue that the main goal of the academy is that what is what to make students better-disciplined citizens. while other public believe that a school is a place where they just give offspring knowledge and give good grades. I agree with this statement because  seminary institutions  teach good qualities and skills that are important for offspring today. I will give some of my opinions which I will explain in this essay

firstly, young generations learn good habits and skills at faculty. the teacher trains each junior to follow the routine and makes the scholar a disciplined and organized person. in addition, the moral values that are taught at hall bring up the heir of the best quality. Maravich department plays a very important role in the upbringing of scion a. for example, r9m during the lesson, many practical lessons are given that are related to the psychology of the graduate to them they are given a task, for example, to choose bad or good what is right or wrong. Today, many schools focus on certain subjects that may help an undergraduate's future career instead of spending too much time on extra subjects for sports or extracurricular activities. 

Secondly , the priority task for the academy is to teach the rules а. of civil behaviour. as a result, it will help to reduce the number of crimes and accidents that occur in the country and maintain discipline among residents. they still have to teach them to follow the rules of aesthetics and, of course, the law of the country and religion. for example, today the most developed countries, this factor is a vulnerable place for them in many cases, many citizens of these countries do not follow the rules and do not maintain discipline. this can be seen in the following situations such as garbage in the streets unclean condition of public transport and in many cases violation of traffic rules and environmental pollution. my opinion is that only an institution can effectively educate these qualities of a nation that offspring from different ages were taught these positive qualities.

"Some people think that competitive sports are important for a child education, others think that it has negative effects.

Without the competitive sports, they unable to learn something's. While, others say that it has negative effects of competitive sports. In the below paragraphs, I will not only explain both the viewpoints, but also my personal perspective.

To start with, those people say that sports are significant for an adolescent education. Firstly, it helps to the adolescent develop their career. For example, when a kid starts their sports with competition. He or she gets a chance to learn about the rules of games, which he or she does not have to learn in the following decades. Moreover, competition helps to improve their physical fitness level as well as encourage to players always speak truth in life. What is more, they earn lots of name and fame from this. Which is useful for the education.

On the flip side, some reckon that it is a negative effect on an adolescent. First of all, the games need to enough of patients. For instance, if a person wants to become a wealthy man throughout sports. He or she has to take practice. Which wastes more time of players. They unable to earn the money as soon. Therefore, they claim that it has negative impacts. Last not but least, competitive sports have to play under the captain.

"Some people think that the best way to solve global environmental problems is to increase the cost of fuel.

To what extent do you agree or disagree.","It is believed by some people that increasing the prices of the fuel is the key to solving environmental problems. In my opinion, I completely agree with this statement.  Firstly, this essay will discuss on how this decision can reduce the emissions of dangerous gases releasing into the air and secondly, explain how it can decrease the overall consumption of this resource utilized by human beings for industrial purposes.
Increasing the price of fuel can reduce the number of vehicles travelling on the streets. This can prevent in emission of greenhouse gases, particularly from vehicles into the air and as a result, it reduces overall pollution, which is also one of the primary  contributing factors in environmental issues. For example, the United Kingdom has recently surged the prices of the fuel and it resulted in lesser traffic and even showed significant difference in the air quality due to lesser hazardous gases released. Therefore, it is clear that increasing the cost can actually make a difference to tackle this problem.
Another reason to consider inclining the prices of the fuel would directly reflect in the reduction of all other industries using fuel as a primary energy source. In other words, several industries use diesel and gas as a primary source of energy to provide electricity to their machines and now people will double check on spending hefty amounts which will eventually reduce the excess consumption of this resource and therefore look for renewable ways to run their machines. It is therefore playing a prominent role in tackling the contributing factors of environmental problems. Hence, it is patently evident that hiking the costs of the fuel is beneficial to the society.
In conclusion, surging the prices of the fuel can tackle environmental problems as it reduces the vehicles that emit gasses into the atmosphere and overall reduction of its consumption which are powering up machines. It is recommended that more and more countries should take this initiative for a better healthy air in the world.","**Task Achievement: 8**

Job applicants’ social skills are more important. Some employers believe that job applicants’ social skills are more important than their academic qualifications. Do you agree or disagree with this opinion?,"Some recruiters value social skills more than academic qualifications when it comes to assessing candidates. I disapprove of this opinion because our professionals will help us most in handling tasks, and interpersonal ability can be acquired continuously after being employed.

First and foremost, many jobs prioritize your certificates or experience in relevant areas. For example, right at the first round of employment, programmers are required to finish at least a good Bachelor's degree in computer science in order to pass. This is because this type of document reflects clearly your level of problem-solving, critical thinking and understanding of what you're going to do in those positions, otherwise, just being decent in sociability doesn't help you anything in coding or system designing.

My second argument is that people skills can be gained through the working process. For instance, most technological firms in Vietnam often organize seminars or side activities to consolidate their employees' communication and English qualities. By doing so, instead of including conversational potential as a must-have criterion when interviewing, companies can teach their staff later, encouraging them to develop their well-rounded capability to be able to promote themselves to higher positions such as project manager or negotiator, and more than that, it's also the best way to bond every member in the organization together.

To conclude, some employers say that for an applicant, his social qualities are more valuable than his achievements in education. I strongly refute this point of view since the knowledge you obtain from your academy is the most helpful tool to complete your deadlines, as well as people can ongoingly learn soft abilities after joining the companies.","**Task Achievement:**

Human activities have a negative effect on plant and animal species. Some people say that it is too late to do anything. Some people think that we should take effective action to improve the situation. Discuss both sides and give your opinion. ??,"There are controversial perspectives heating up a debate over how to solve the negative effect issue caused by human activities on plant and animal species. While some hold a strong view that it is too late to measure the problem, the opposite makes a statement that we should enhance the situation with effective actions. I would contend that take effective actions to revamp the matters, which do more good than harm.

 It is obvious to note that there are many reasons to convince that it is too late in order to solve the negative effect of human activities on plant and animal species, one of them is deforestation. Having an ever-growing demand for land to live and wood to consume, humans decide on deforestation to serve their purpose. Therefore, it leads to flora and fauna being indiscriminately destroyed and lost completely instead of being replaced and it pushes many categories of species on the verge of extinction.  For example, Panda is China’s national treasure, but this species is on the brink of extinction because of deforestation. There is a wealth of animals in the world that are dying out because of human activities, which is the reason people doubt that it is too late to tackle the problem. 

 While the redeeming features of negative effects of human activities on flora and fauna species are widely acknowledged, we will find an address in order to enhance the issue. Plant and animal species play a paramount significant role in human’s life, so we should find a solution as soon as possible. One of the remedies is to build a reserve to create a safe habitat for endangered animals. For instance, Cuc Phuong national park in Vietnam is built and overseen by the authorities, which is home for a wave of precious animals. Hence, the situation will be resolved and revamped if people actively implement it.             

 In conclusion, although there are many reasons to prove that it is too late to deal with the negative effect on plant and animal species caused by human activities, people should take effective action to improve the problem.","**Task Achievement:**

While some traditional customs including unconditionally following policies made by the king have been replaced by the democratic political system, there are still quite some traditional customs that adapt well to modern society. For example, people in east asian countries are still used to shaking hands when they meet new friends or business partners, which has been followed for more than 1000 years and is still a great way to help quickly establish friendship or business cooperation. Consequently, those kinds of traditional customs should be kept.

Another important reason for keeping certain traditional customs and behaviours is that they are essential records of human history. For instance, in the Western world, people celebrate Christmas and in many countries in East Asia and Southeast Asia such as China and Vietnam, people celebrate Lunar New Year, which gathers family members together and reminds people of the history of their ancestors. These traditional customs have built a bridge between modern civilization and ancient history, which is a priceless treasure in human beings’ history. Therefore, it is important to preserve some traditional customs.

In conclusion, although some outdated traditional customs deserve to be abandoned in the modern world, I firmly believe that some traditional customs are vital parts of human history and are still applicable in modern society and thus should be kept.","## Task Achievement:

"Some people believe that studying at university or college is the best route to a successful career, while others believe that it is better to get a job straight after school.


Discuss both views and give your opinion?","A faction of the society opines that working right after completing school has better career prospects. However, the other set believes in the importance of college or university learning in charting a successful and prosperous career. Despite seeing many examples of college dropouts building huge businesses, I strongly agree with the latter view that academic education plays a critical role in a person's career path.

On the one hand, the obvious reason for recommending working right after completing school, is the success of a few billionaires who skipped academics and made it big. For example, Facebook built by Mark Zuckerberg, and Apple built by Steve Jobs are inspiring stories of college dropouts. Both these highly talented individuals did not complete university education and rather went about building their companies which are now massive business conglomerates. On the other hand, many stories of thousands of college dropouts are unknown because they did not find good jobs or create a successful business, and are still struggling to make ends meet. Therefore, it is incorrect to bias one's opinion, keeping in mind, only a few successful people. 

In contrast, the benefits of completing higher studies are manifold. Not only does the individual gain immense knowledge, but also gets to build a huge network of friends and acquaintances. The course curriculum often teaches examples of hundreds of companies and the reasons of their pitfalls and success. Furthermore, this knowledge gathered by discussing case-studies with peers is considered immensely beneficial later in their careers. To illustrate it further, an extensive survey conducted on 1000 executives of mid-sized companies, demonstrated that almost 80% of them gave credit to their alma mater for the success they have built. In addition, they always prefer to choose employees who have completed their college education.

In conclusion, from the arguments and explanation given above it is clear that despite having a few phenomenal college dropouts, majority people in the society value higher education. I firmly believe that completing higher studies is an imperative determinant of one's future career success, and strongly advocate that students should not drop out midway during their studies.","## Task Achievement:

Some people think that robots are important for humans’ future development. Other think that robot have negative effects on society. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"Artificial intelligence and mechanical electronics have been the core of contemporary advancement. Robotics is now a field that is not unknown and the spike, we are seeing in its implementation is something huge. Today, robots are present everywhere whether it is at home as your cleaner and vacuum or in the operation theatre as surgeons' assistants. However, the opinions on it are quite the opposite. Some believe that it is the best invention in the history of mankind while some believe otherwise. I opine that its benefits are weighed higher on the scale as compared to its drawbacks

To begin with, robots have taken the world by storm through the outcome and  their performance. The first and foremost advantage is it has never been so easy to solve complex problems as it is today. robots have the innate ability to do various tasks together and to provide accurate answers. Secondly, they are now sharing the workload of human beings by performing various levels of  work thus providing them with  a sense of relaxation. For instance, many surgeries are now performed by Da Vinci which is a specialized robot to assist surgeons and in this way, half of the burden has been reduced.

On the other side, there are drawbacks that should be taken into consideration. One of them is the industry will soon be converted into an AI-driven workforce and as a ,result millions of people will be jobless as e!employers will prefer this one-time investment instead of paying an amount every month to the employee. Another thing that is alarming is the lack of power to change decisions timely. These electronics work on the installed and manufactured intelligence therefore they do not have the capability to switch their mode according to circumstances. For example, if a robot is teaching a class that is not disciplined, it has no power to process how to keep children motivated.

In conclusion, I would like to say that in spite of a few deficiencies, it is going to help human beings in great ways in the near future . All we need to understand is that these creatures can take up our responsibilities but can never give us  emotional support. So, use the robots but stay connected to the people","## Task Achievement:

Whether or not someone achieve their aims is mostly by a question of luck. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Many people claim that luck is the most crucial element contributing to a person's success. While I accept that luck does have an important role in helping people reach their targets, I would argue that hard work and determination are much more crucial factors leading to the achievement of an individual. 

On the one hand, I agree that luck can be an important factor. First, some people are fortunate enough to be born in a wealthy family, which allows them to have a better education or to easily start their own business without having to borrow money from someone else. As a result, these people tend to have better opportunities to succeed than those coming from poor families. Furthermore, some individuals are lucky to be given great talents which others do not have. For example, Mozart was able to play music when he was very young, or Lionel Messi already had great football skills when he was born. 

However, I would argue that although luck can be necessary, it is not the most crucial factor leading to success. Firstly, people need to work really hard and put much effort into their jobs if they want to be successful. For instance, before becoming one of the best football players in the world, Cristiano Ronaldo had to go through intense training hours every day for many years. Secondly, a person is less likely to reach his targets if he does not have determination. On the way leading to success, there might be many difficulties, and people need to keep moving forward to overcome those challenges. 

In conclusion, while I agree that luck is important to some extent in helping people become successful, I believe that hard work and determination are the most important elements.","**Task Achievement:** 8.5

Some people think that money spent on developing the technology for space exploration is not justified. There are more beneficial ways to spend this money. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"The technology from the very beginning has two aspects, if it is used in the right way it is beneficial for survival, but if it is utilized in the wrong way it may be worse for the whole mankind. A  popular stratum of society believes that spending wealth in the development of space exploration is necessary. However, in its sharp contrast, others opine that it is the sheer wastage of money which could rather be used to eradicate other issues of the community. I would like to delve into both the arguments before making an opinion.

The first school of thought claims that evolution of space technology has brought humans the possibilities of life in outer space, which is a huge achievement. According to some researchers, the end of the earth can be expected as a consequence of factors like pollution, global warming, etc. So, the space scientists are working on projects to produce habitat on other planets. They believe that without exploring the space or other planet physically we cannot have any idea about it. Moreover, without having prior knowledge of other spheres we cannot live there. In addition to this, developing space technology is compulsory.

However, another group of person opines that spending wealth on space technology is surely a wastage of it. Every year a huge amount of money is spent on this by different countries to just prove their strength. They believe that as we live on earth humans should not face problems in their daily life to run their lives smoothly. Instead of spending too much money on space exploration program e governments should spend on social issues. For example, governments should provide jobs for their pupil, they should construct better infrastructure  for better development, they should provide better medical facilities and much more.

In the conclusion, I would conclude that developing automation for space exploration is good for mankind, but this fact cannot be denied that it requires a huge amount of fund. The governmental bodies should also keep a regular check on social issues to bring happiness into people's lives and on planet earth.","## Task Achievement:

Some people think the money spent on developing the technology for space exploration is not justified. There are more beneficial ways to spend this money. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Some people are of the opinion that the fund which is used to explore the universe should be spent on more practical sectors instead. While I concur that the ambition of studying outer space is justifiable, I believe that the government should use this amount of money for other purposes which bring more benefit to citizens.

On the first hand, for decades, it is undeniable that the growth of humanity has been mostly based on people's curiosity, which makes exploring celestial bodies more necessary to keep pace with the world's development. Firstly, the technology for aerospace investigation is one of the methods which has triggered people to reach certain achievements. For instance, scientists carry out many studies in the labs located on other planets to find more resources to provide to the earth's life. Besides, the experiments on the universe distinctly bring some benefits in the future such as broadening knowledge about interactions between planets, then people can predict upcoming disasters due to out-of-the-earth factors.

On the other hand, it is apparent why many are in favour of allocating the money which is for space exploration on more advantageous aspects. The most conspicuous reason is that humans in recent years have faced many problems, particularly, environmental degradation and severe transmitted diseases. In detail, the environmental concerns are more and more significant because there has been no practical measure to tackle factory waste and emission. Otherwise, owing to the budget shortage, not everyone around the world is accessible to medical services which have been a burden to the healthcare system. Meanwhile, beyond-Earth research requires a large amount of money which can be used in finding proper solutions for those existing problems.

In view of the arguments outlined above, I conclude that although getting to know about the cosmos is important, improving current problems is more a priority to society. All things considered, from my perspective, space exploration is not a proper way to use the government subsidy in this situation.","## Task Achievement: [8.0]

Some people believe that the government should not spend money on international aid when they have their own disadvantaged people like homeless and unemployed. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Some individuals suppose that the government should allocate financial resources to other impoverished countries while others believe that it is of paramount importance to focus on solving their domestic issues. From my point of view, I strongly agree with the proposal of determining national priority on internal problems.

On the one hand, it is undeniable that cross-border support is a symbol of humanity. Geographically, people are divided into different ethnicities but by nature, it will be the core of connecting features among individuals. Thus, aiding the poor stems from the consciousness and heart of each resident and is not solely contingent on monetary contributions. Not to mention that helping other nations to encounter  financial crises would eliminate the chances of illegal migration which is detrimental to surrounding developed regions. For example, back to the COVID-19 pandemic, with  assistance from the whole world related to foods, vaccines,... etc, leading to a sustainable society as well as expressing humanity among several nations.

Nevertheless, I am of the opinion that concentrating on addressing domestic issues such as homelessness or unemployment should be of the utmost urgency in any country. To begin with, the financial fund from the government is regarded as a crucial means to reserve and maintain welfare schemes as well as social security. The smooth flow of how society works would generate a favourable environment for employment opportunities which accordingly increases the economic growth rate. Furthermore, employment prospects, consequently, generate more personal budgets which people can use to afford decent accommodation decreasing the homelessness rate.

In conclusion, although transnational support should be executed as a gesture of humanity, I still believe that the government should put the goal of tackling internal issues in a country to be the top priority.","## Task Achievement:

The increase in the production of consumer goods results in damage to the natural environment. What are the causes of this? What can be done to solve this problem?,"It is widely argued that the growth of the number of factories producing customer products has a negative impact on various aspects of the natural habitat. The essay attempts to shed light on the driving factors behind this negative view before outlining several viable solutions that should be adopted to tackle the mentioned problem. 

There are two primary reasons why some individuals often consider the production of consumer goods as a cause of many serious issues in the natural habitat. One reason is, it often starts from the origin of products that serve people's daily needs. We can name a lot of goods such as food, drinks, pencils, paper, clothes, or electronics. They are mass-produced to meet human needs, so large firms are needed to resolve this problem. Of course, it is quite difficult to build large-scale factories in the city, on the contrary, they are built in the countryside, leading to many consequences for the surrounding areas. A large number of trees were cut down to give way to new factories, reducing the area of forest cover significantly. In addition, their waste that is not properly treated will harm the soil and water habitat, affecting aquatic or underground ecosystems. Another reason is that some customer merchandise is produced with natural ingredients. For instance, paper is made of wood, and dishes are made of sand. The ensure them to mass production leads to the over-exploitation of these resources, leading to the risk of imbalance in the natural ecosystem.

To combat this worrying concern, the following feasible steps should be taken. First and foremost, the unquestionable impacts of production companies on the surrounding areas should be promoted widely through official media. As a result, local residents could be able to be aware of the economic benefits that also affect the environment which manufacturing firms play in their lives, thereby making them change their oppositional or acceptable attitudes towards these companies. Furthermore, governing bodies should enforce strict regulations on these commodities manufacturing industries. For example, they could impose heavy fines on those littering or polluting the local environment to these manufacturing firms, which could protect the local environment from being contaminated by the irresponsible behaviour of these enterprises.

In conclusion, there are some underlying motives behind this negative perception towards the industry of consumer products, and it is crucial that the aforementioned measures be implemented to change this oppositional perspective.","**Task Achievement:**

To begin with, applying for prestigious establishments can assist citizens to achieve their ambitions and give them the best chances to improve their knowledge. Because  the universities have well-known professors that they have professional experience and can help people to become successful. For example, when people have gone to universities, they have developed their practical skills such as  communication skills, time management and leadership skills and these skills can influence  their future lives. In my opinion, going to top universities provide students with comprehensive educations that we cannot find  in any place. Consequently, becoming more successful in life can result in effective education in universities.

On the other hand, getting experience or doing something you like can help you become professional rather than having academic degrees. Sometimes people pursue their ambitions or learn some skills that they want, and these goals can persuade them to become successful. For instance, C. Ronaldo is  one of the best soccer players in the world that does not have any academic degrees, and just he has endless effort. In my view, however, this statement can be accurate, the best way to become a successful person in your life is high-level education in universities.

In conclusion, getting prestigious establishments is the best way that can assist people to become the professional people in their lives, whereas some others believe that  not more important as experiences and goals. In my opinion, academic educations can cultivate practical skills that obtain more success in our lives.","### Task Achievement: 7.5

"Some people think that children should not watch television because it has negative effects, while others believe that televison helps children. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","Globally, a few humans believe that youngsters should use television but others do not have the same thoughts. TV is a good tool for learning in this generation since technology has become significant presently. Its bad effects cannot  be overlooked. I think its utilisation for youngsters is essential for their mental development.

    To begin with, viewing a TV set has a positive impact on the intellectual development of a child. It prompts them to challenge their brains and generate ideas especially while seeing educational channels like lingo kids.Certain situations have shown improvements in learning grammar if a kid is consistent in watching English programmes. In ,addition it serves as a form of entertainment for lads during holiday periods. For example, videos and cartoons are basic measures of fun.The role of screens is important in every child's development.

       The universal use of home screens has contributed to reduced morals exhibited by juveniles of today. A lot of adult shows are aired freely and these children have the freedom to watch them. Recent statistics have shown that about 50- 60% of users of porn hub sites are humans of age 9 to 14.Furthermore, it is time-consuming. A minor spends about 5 hours watching channels and this time could be used for other valuable activities such as domestic chores.

     In my opinion, visualising TVs has shown to be essential to optimal brain activities of children. Younger ones who view educative channels regularly have more confidence in dealing with life challenges.For instance, seeing people do debates on Sets gives children the confidence that every idea is valid.Also, televisions are used for virtual feedback for young lads with cerebral palsy. Thus the use of home screens by boys and girls is a significant part of growth.

      In conclusion, the good effects of viewing TV sets by children are very essential in this modern world although their bad factors are there too.Subsequently, every offspring is encouraged to see home screens for at least 30mins to 1 hour daily.","## Task Achievement:

The best way to teach children to cooperate is through team sports at school. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Team sports usually promote good values for the community. Some people say that children should learn to cooperate by practising this kind of sport at school. My opinion, I strongly agree that teaching cooperation through team sports would be the best way for pupils to incorporate this attitude into their lives. 

Nowadays, soccer, rugby, hockey and volleyball are incredibly famous around the globe and kids know them very well as they watch them on the TV and even practise them in sports centres but also at school. In particular, physical education teachers always try to introduce the students to the beautiful world of  cooperative activities by explaining the rules of each sport and then letting them practise in the field. For example, in  practice, they need to organise into two teams and play soccer when they have to pass the ball to score, they need to trust and know each other in order to improvise with the ball. It is a fact that children adore playing and doing exercise, so why not use it to help them to improve their collaborative skills?

In addition to this, teachers can motivate children to compete in regional tournaments where they need to strengthen their relationships to create a strong group and to improve human values like cooperation and respect. For instance, in the school where I used to work, every year was a great competition in which all the students from all levels used to participate. Teamwork through different activities and sports was implemented, and even the families were involved in organising meals and supporting their children. There is no doubt that the kids were highly motivated and really enjoyed the tournament.

In conclusion, teaching sports at school, where pupils can learn how to organise themselves in the field like a team and get motivated to participate in scholar competitions would contribute to making a huge change in their attitude and the manner in which they interact with each other. Sports may not be the only way to teach this, but it is by far the most practical way to teach the young to act cooperatively in their community.","**Task Achievement:**

"In some countries, more and more people are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the house or building they live in. What are the reasons for this? How can people research this?","Presently, people who live in some nations have a tendency to observe the narrative of their house or accommodation. This article will elaborate on the reasons for this trend and the best approach to do research on this issue.

To begin with, the main reasons why some are curious about the story of their accommodation are for  economic purposes and to understand their ancestors for their identity matters. For the first reason, it is clear that individuals who have old buildings which contain historical values will benefit  financially. This means that they can sell their belonging to collectors or simply build them as historical sites and promotes them to attract visitors. Another reason is  to understand their founding fathers. By knowing it, people may build a sense of identity ,particularly  individuals who live in multicultural cities such as London and New York. Moreover, they can give this valuable information to their children that their cultural backgrounds even races are rooted in Africa or Asian regions such as China and Southeast Asian countries. 

In order to reach reliable information about the historical aspect of their residence, one of the best methods is an interview. In means that they can acquire data from neighbours who may live for a long time in the area where they live in. For instance, they can prepare a questionnaire for elderly citizens who know well about the story behind the residence in its surrounding. In addition, they can add  gathering data from local history museums or from  old documents that are usually located in local or even national libraries. Therefore, by doing this research they can collect  trustworthy data from reliable sources.

In conclusion, understanding the house's narrative has a significant role in their life. Although there are multiple reasons to do this, economic reason and identity objectives are the main objectives behind this phenomenon. It is crucial for them to do interviews with citizens who live around the house to gather the best information related to this topic.","## Task Achievement:

"Some people think news has no connection to people's lives, so it is a waste of time to read the news in newspapers and watch television news programs. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Numerous characters deem watching TV and reading magazines as a wastage of time, as there is no correlation to citizens' lives; meanwhile, certain groups of people oppose and affirm many necessary pieces of information get announced by the news program. I reckon we should not glean a public's daily news from the press, TV, broadcast, and other media. 

First of all, it got proved that affluent people and wealthy politicians give a bribe to media and TV channels to deceive the population for various reasons. If one of the parliament members offends some major crimes, he or she can conceal the offence by using the power of media deluding people, which is a classical way how the press earns. There are countless incidences relating to this in Mongolia. One of these is Tuvshin, a member of parliament congress, who hid successfully the fact that he raped a girl, and stole a large amount of money from the government thanks to the media, which is one example. Hence, it is crucial to do not believe news reported by media.

Secondly, insofar as the objective of the press and webs is to captivate as many readers as possible so that they can make more money. Many websites are posting many numbers of intriguing news, gossips, and other juicy info through the internet and social media every day. For example, you can observe that there are many trashy but juicy posts on Facebook uploaded by websites. Therefore, we have to react perceptively to these uncertain pieces of information.

In conclusion, I firmly believe that taking information from the media is utterly a wrong idea, as they usually provide citizens with fallacious news. Thus, I state again we must not advocate this.","**Task Achievement:**

Human activities have negative effects on plants and animal species. Some people think that it is too late to do anything about this problem. Other people believe that effective measures can be taken to improve this situation. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"Environmental conservation has become a trending topic in recent years. Pessimists claim that there is nothing that can be done to save the Earth, while others argue that human beings still have a chance to modify the situation. In my view, I agree with the latter and I will provide an explanation with examples.

First of all, it is undeniable that human activities have brought a number of serious problems to the Earth due to the increase in human demands based on populations. For instance, the average temperature has increased one Celsius since the 1800s, which mainly caused by deforestation, farming and burning fossil fuels. This leads to a threat to many Arctic species such as polar bears in particular as their habitat is melting and disappearing.

On the other hand, others including me believe there is still hope because the awareness of environmental protection and sustainable development has raised in recent decades. To be more precise, many countries have started to tackle the negative effects brought by human beings, like reducing overexploitation of natural resources. Instead, professionals are researching and finding other renewable and Eco-friendly resources to limit the demands on fuels. Besides, afforestation is encouraged to offset the damage by deforestation. China is one of the best examples, which the overall forest coverage rate has risen from twelve per cent in the early 1980s to twenty-three per cent currently. As a result, the air quality in China has improved dramatically compared with thirty years ago.

In conclusion, even if human activities have caused grave consequences and even some permanent damage to our plants and wildlife, it is not completely irretrievable as long as human beings can learn from previous mistakes and insist on sustainable development.","### Task Achievement: 8

The typical teaching situation of a teacher and students in the class will not exist by the year 2050. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Numerous characters deem our conventional educating program will be altered, and students will not be attending class; in contrast, certain groups of people oppose and affirm pupils will be studying at school. Besides this, the old educational program will be lasting as usual. I reckon the current model will surely be changed by the 2050s.

Firstly, I view the revolution has already started. Thanks to cutting edge technology, now we have more options to continue lessons and business. For example, all college, universities, and companies stopped to work because of coronavirus, rendering people to live under quarantine, but still, my university's teachers have been lecturing their lessons using the internet and social channels including Facebook, Google Meet, and Zoom. Hence, this trend will definitely influence the traditional tutor and student interaction.

Secondly, this brand new teaching approach is more sustainable and effortless than any method which had been existed before. As arriving at school and coming back home takes a lot of time, and we usually do not attend class when we ill. However, we can take a course from schools by using a mobile phone or computer today, which is simple and has no obstacle. For instance, since I started acquiring knowledge from the internet curriculum; I realized that it took fewer hours than taking tutorials from the college. Thus, I prefer this new trend and presume its enhancement is inevitable.

Some people think that robots are important for human’s future development. Others think that robots have negative effects on society. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"In recent years, humans are heavily adapted to advanced technologies and it has become an integral part of life. Robots are considered to be one of the greatest innovations of mankind. Certain individuals believe that they are harmful to humans while some stratum of society argue that they are crucial for the future. I personally believe that robotics is a positive development for the world.

To begin with, some people assert that these techno-savvy machines can endanger human life. This is because robots are not emotionally intelligent to distinguish what set of operations are right or wrong; which can have a detrimental effect. To illustrate, a recent accident involving a Telsa electric car that killed two people points fingers at its autonomous driving feature. Moreover, these robots running on a specific algorithm are in the early stage of development that can be exposed to hacking. For instance, if these machines are employed in the banking sector, there is a high probable chance of account hacking and other fraudulent activities. 

On the other hand, benefits derived from the invention of robots are significant for the development of the future. Most importantly, these automated machines can be deployed in places that are hazardous to humans. For example, a robot called Mini-Manbo has become the central part of the cleaning-up process in the damaged Fukushima reactor, where it is dangerous for humans to execute these tasks. Additionally, the heavy automation by robots in the automobile industry and hazardous chemical plants has reduced stress on employee’s health and increased productivity and precision in these sectors.

In conclusion, although, some argue that robots can be potentially life-threatening and cannot be considered safe to be employed in various industries such as banking, I strongly believe that they can bring a positive change for the future.","## Task Achievement:
